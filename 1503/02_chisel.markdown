* Project GitHub URL: https://github.com/davemaurer/chisel
* Fundamental Ruby & Style
  * 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
  * 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
  * 2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
  * 1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution
* Test-Driven Development
  * 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
  * 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
  * 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
  * 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
* Functionality
  * 4: Application implements all base functionality and two extensions
  * 3: Application implements all base functionality
  * 2: Application is missing or has issues with one component of the base expectations
  * 1: Application has issues with more than one component of base expectations
* Breaking Logic into Components
  * 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
  * 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
  * 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
  * 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together
* Notes:

* Notes: Nice work overall; covers a good amount of functionality with a
decent volume of tests. A few edge cases lacking and some of the
element objects could have absorbed more responsibility to slim down the
main chisel class.

* Notes: Nice Job; good project which meets all the expectations and has
  some nice design choices going on. There are a few cases where the design
abstractions fall down or could have gone a little further (Link
parsing; piping/chaining multiple elements together). Test
implementations are great and the tests seem pretty attentive to how the
objects will be used in the system

* Notes: Not bad overall. Fairly good division between objects; test
  coverage is thorough with a few gaps here and there of edge cases that
  could have been covered. Would have liked to see some more parallelism
  between structures of different elements so that they could be rendered
  more dynamically (via an enumerator or some such).
