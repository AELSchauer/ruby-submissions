### Eval Template

#### Server-Side Application and APIs

* 4 - Project wraps/isolates external API, tests API interaction without actual connectivity dependencies
* 3 - Project wraps/isolates external API but has some gaps or external connections in its testing
* 2 - Project uses an external API, but usage is scattered across the application *OR* its usage is not effectively tested
* 1 - Project does not effectively utilize the third party API

#### Test-Driven Development

* 4 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>80%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external services.
* 3 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>70%), tests at feature and unit levels, but relies on external services
* 2 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>60%), but does not adequately balance feature and unit tests
* 1 - The code does not have 80% test coverage

#### Features

Does it have the expected features?

* 4 - There are more features than we planned
* 3 - All planned features were delivered
* 2 - Some features were sacrificed to meet the deadline
* 1 - Major features are missing and/or the application is not deployed to production

#### Interface

Does it have a highly usable interface?

* 4 - The application is a logical and easy to use implementation of the target application
* 3 - The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality
* 2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective
* 1 - The application is confusing or difficult to use
