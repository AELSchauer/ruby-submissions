### Eval Template

#### Server-Side Application and APIs

* 4 - Project wraps/isolates external API, tests API interaction without actual connectivity dependencies
* 3 - Project wraps/isolates external API but has some gaps or external connections in its testing
* 2 - Project uses an external API, but usage is scattered across the application *OR* its usage is not effectively tested
* 1 - Project does not effectively utilize the third party API

#### Test-Driven Development

* 4 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>80%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external services.
* 3 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>70%), tests at feature and unit levels, but relies on external services
* 2 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>60%), but does not adequately balance feature and unit tests
* 1 - The code does not have 80% test coverage

#### Features

Does it have the expected features?

* 4 - There are more features than we planned
* 3 - All planned features were delivered
* 2 - Some features were sacrificed to meet the deadline
* 1 - Major features are missing and/or the application is not deployed to production

#### Interface

Does it have a highly usable interface?

* 4 - The application is a logical and easy to use implementation of the target application
* 3 - The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality
* 2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective
* 1 - The application is confusing or difficult to use

### Justin Holmes:
     
     
Notes: " 92.38 percent test coverage missing some test coverage, namely logout, favorite, user exists. Good stub to test logging in.
	  No user model test, though most of that functionality is covered in the login test.
