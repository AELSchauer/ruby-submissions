Tests have excellent coverage of edge cases for model tests. Tests are clear and easy to understand. Feature tests could cover more user interface.
JS code is clean and easy to read. Callbacks could be extracted into separate functions. Responsibilities of each function are clear and intuitive.
Excellent code quality, code is very clear, concise, and clean across the board. I like your use of rails helper methods and gems. App is very easy for users to navigate and the interface is very intuitive.
