* I really liked the user interface. Clean and simple to use.
* I would really be nice to see some of your html in partials.

__Comments__

Liked that you used FactoryGirl for tests.
Liked that you did the form validation with the alert
Liked that you specified the title and body for the keyup filter

Would have been nice to figure out respond_with rather than respond_to
Index action creates an @ideas variable AND an @idea variable
