#### Rick Bacci

Github: https://github.com/RickBacci/foobr
Production: https://foobr.herokuapp.com

__Notes__

* Code and tests are actually pretty good based on what is written
* Nothing works at the moment
* JS code is pretty clean
* Use of VCR and omniauth stubbing for testing is good
* Seem to have serious problems with process and attention to detail
in development
* Feels like projects are going well up to a point but then we get sidetracked
by some issue or malfunction
* Need to be more reactive or adaptive when running into issues so that we
can find a way around rather than getting bogged down on a single issue

* **Test-Driven Development**: 1
* **Code Quality**: 3
* **User Experience**: 2 - Project exhibits some gaps in the UX.
* **Performance**:  3 - Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

__Notes__

* Overall code is quite clean
* One crufty method in app controller which should probably be split up
* Testing is a big gap -- effectively little to none of it except
on login
* Not addressing usage of external service in tests
* Overall just not as much code or technical stuff happening as there probably
should be -- would be interesting to see more usage of the API somehow
* Additionally the main api endpoint we are consuming should probably be a
different one -- we're consuming by exact match on name query when we could
use an actual search endpoint which would give a much better UX
* Shows some lack of pace and mastery, so we should continue to focus on
these aspects as we go into next module
* View layer is clean; not a lot of messes here

* **Code Quality**: 4

__Notes__

* Code quality is quite good; getting pretty competent at OO
barrier identification and extracting pieces of the system
* View layer also is exceptionally clean
* Good job on extracting logic into small methods etc
* Testing needs lots of work
* Even the tests we do have don't really get into the material
important parts of the app
* External service interactions are untouched in the tests. Need
some stubs or at least use of VCR

__Notes__

* Would like to see more restful rails routing
* Avoid use of helpers for data logic -- push it into a model
or PORO instead
* Javascript competence is clearly coming along but still could
be more idomatic etc
* OO design contains the right pieces and is pretty good at the micro
level (method design etc), but the relationships between components
could be more clearly defined
* Testing is pretty good and I like that we address the external connections
using Omniauth test mode and stubs
* Data modeling is interesting and makes reasonable use of the standard rails
tooling; given the relative static-ness of the data it might be interesting
to think about alternative modeling / storage systems
(could we just hardcode the weather / drink data since it's static)

__Notes__

* Good job managing interaction of various tools across the multiple APIs
* Doing a good job of getting the task done; would like to see some more
curiosity or exploration of OO design techniques applied toward
enriching the shape of the app
* Testing is excptionally thorough on specific things (i.e. validations)
but skirts around the true logic of the app, which deals with synthesizing
and aggregrating data against various third-party APIs
* Coverage report (82 %) shows various important parts of the app un-touched by tests
* Several of the interesting technical challenges are basically offloaded
onto external tools (Devise, shuffling JS) so that we don't really contend with them
* Testing leaves external service connections untouched
* For a small app the testing coverage is not very thorough
* Leaving too much of essential logic embedded in the view templates, especially
when the rest of the app is so light in business logic

#### Whitney Hiemstra

Github: https://github.com/whithub/music_story
Production: http://music-story.herokuapp.com/

__Notes__

* Testing is great -- managed the external network dependencies with VCR
and Oauth dependency with Omniauth stubbing, and utilized some clever RSpec
features to make it all pretty transparent
* Has thorough coverage of user interactions at an integration level
* Rails routing and controllers are idiomatic, restful, and tidy
* Still has some logic leaking into view templates; much of this could be
resolved by using additional POROs (Presenter/Decorator) to soak up
some of these responsibilities
* Additionally, having some additional utility objects in the system would
give us a place to do more unit testing

#### Morgan Miller

Github: https://github.com/morganmiller/whats-in-a-word
Production: http://whatsinaword.herokuapp.com/

__Notes__

* Testing: could use some integration testing but model testing is strong enough
to compensate
* Good use of VCR to isolate network connections
* "Micro" code level is pretty clean with a few exceptions of crufty methods
* Naming could be improved in several places (classes like "Parser" or "Requester")
* Finally we do have a lot of things going on in the app and the hierarchy among
methods in each object is not always easy to follow
* Could potentially resolve this with more smaller objects which each grabs
a handful of responsibilities
* Some of the data parsing could be better written as a pipeline of filters
on top of initial data set; currently the various steps and queries and transformations
are somewhat tangled

Production: http://group-tindering.herokuapp.com/

__Notes__

* Cool idea
* Existing code is very tidy and straightforward rails style, but there just
is not enough of it
* Seems like some of the harder questions haven't fully been resolved (esp. around
API login and token-based access to Tinder data)
* Tests as written seem good but all are failing, and it seems we have not fully
resolved API-testing issues, which is probably accountable for most of the failures
