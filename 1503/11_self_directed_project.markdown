Github:
Production:

* **Completion**:
* **Organization**:
* **Test-Driven Development**: 3 - (Some sad paths not tested and Omniauth tests are missing but all core functionality is tested)

#### Jamie Kawahara

Github:
Production:

* **Completion**:
* **Organization**:
* **Test-Driven Development**: 3 - 91.5% (Omniauth not tested)
* **Code Quality**: 3 - Good use of Service object and Background workers. Could refactor Service usage duplication, using a presenter in the controller, and using ActiveRecord to limit records loaded into memory.
