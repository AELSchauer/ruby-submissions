### Rubric Template

1. Feature Completion

  * 3: Completes all base features (through iteration 4) and 1 supporting feature
  * 2: Is missing some base features
  * 1: Is missing multiple base features
2. Project Organization
  * 4: Team makes great use of git workflow, project management tool, and iterative workflow
  * 3: Team generally makes good use of git and project workflow, but has a few "git dump" PRs or dropped tickets
  * 2: Team attempts to use project management practices, but the result is largely disorganized or non-committal
  * 1: Team is lacking project organization practices
3. Test-Driven Development
  * 4: Exceptional use of testing at all levels of the application. Good balance across test types. Tests exercise important functionality and guide design of application.
  * 3: Solid test coverage. Slightly heavier reliance on one layer over another, and some gaps, but important features are generally well-covered.
  * 2: Some gaps in testing. Application leans almost exclusively on one layer over another, and leaves important functions untested.
  * 1: Disregard for testing
4. Code Quality
  * 4: Exceptionally well factored code. Great application of MVC and good use of Ruby objects
  to encapsulate responsibilities.
  * 3: Solid code quality. A few small leaks of responsibility, but logic is pushed down the stack and
  generally clearly encapsulated.
  * 2: Application of MVC leaks in some places. Several disorganized or poorly factored methods.
  * 1: Poor factoring of code and application of MVC principles.
5. User Experience
  * 4: UX is especially polished and intuitive
  * 3: UX is clear and makes it easy to navigate around the site
