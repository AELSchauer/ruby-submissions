    notes: Reached for ruby within a handful of quieries. No model level tests, but controller tests had moderate to good robustness. Some stretegy changes were suggested within testing. Some refactoring of queries would have been good.

    instructor: Andrew
    notes: Good project. Queries fall to ruby sometimes but does use advanced active record too. TDD was good at the controller level but not at model level. Only two model level.

    notes: Code quality could be focused on more. The controllers had some issues. Testing was good overall but could have used some model tests.

    notes: Great quieries but did reach for some ruby. Good code quality. Overall a good project. The tests were really good. To be perfect there would be more tests for find and findall etc, but there were good unit and controller tests.

    notes: Most important thing to work on moving forward is refactoring. Code uality was ok, but could have reworked some queries. Only one piece of logic in controller, but it was the last thing being worked. No model level tests and some gaps controller test robustness.

    notes: Solid project. Good robust controller tests, but no model tests. Could have done some more for testing. Quieries were good and had mostly activerecord, but did reach for ruby. At times I think the ruby was unessesary and could have been accomplished fairly easily with AR.

    notes: Great project. Some ruby for queries. 100% completion. Did not use serializers so api design was a 3. Tests were good but could have done more at the model level.

    notes: Exceptional queries. Not so great test suite. Could have had a lot more controller tests. There where a handful of merchant model tests which I liked to see. Code quality was also good.
