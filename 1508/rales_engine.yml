    notes: Solid project. Some queries there was a little confusion about but the queries themselves were solid. Hashes used to format instead of serializers.
    completion: 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.
    test-driven-development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
    code-quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
    api-design: 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.
    queries: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

    notes: 5 failures. A lot of tests (98%) but some don't test functionality. MVC is really solid. Super clean Controllers and Models. Using hashes in the model to format for the JSON response; should use serializers.

    notes: Really solid project. Great testing. Some queries could have been better, however there's a clear trajectory of improvment. Several queries were really clean and showed an understanding of advanced AR concepts.
