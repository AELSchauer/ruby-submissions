    notes: 5 failures. A lot of tests (98%) but some don't test functionality. MVC is really solid. Super clean Controllers and Models. Using hashes in the model to format for the JSON response; should use serializers.
    completion: 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.
    test-driven-development: 3+: Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.
    code-quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
    api-design: 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.
    queries: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.
