Production Link: ganesha-loans.herokuapp.com  

Notes: Good project delivered. Very painful load times, but no crashes. Used waffle as project management tool. Kept user experience as a 3 even though it was painful to user because the UI was well constructed. Delivery was as expected but nothing above and beyond.
