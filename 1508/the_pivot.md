Notes: 96% coverage and really good feature tests. Could use more model tests. Really good use of POROs. Over use of helpers in controllers, should be moved to helpers directory. Nice attempt at moving that logic out of the views though.

Notes:
  * Some gaps in testing. Some code is executing but not providing or testing the actual business value.
  * Most are solid and when adjusting during the to make them more robust they still passed.
  * Took good risks and went above and beyond expectations without the code quality suffering.
