### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
One thing I as pretty unfamiliar with was how easy Factory Girl made it to set up 
relationships in your testing. My tests before look like a giant mess of let blocks.
Now they're only a small mess of lets.

### Summarize what you worked on
I worked on creating a front end to display the data we pulled in from our job scraper.
The main thing was ensuring that if we had bad or missing data that the app didn't fall
over and so required that I test multiple cases of data.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

Scary at first! But after having a few it's not a big deal. I think the main reason for 
this is the emphasis on leaving both positive and negative feedback. It feels good to know
someone actually looked at your code and thought about it makes criticism feel like just that,
and nothing personal.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

I did enjoy standing up since we spend most of our time on our butts. It also did feel
 a lot easier to be in touch with where everyone was and it didn't feel like there was a cowboy
 taking off and leaving everyone behind.
