# The Plan

On Monday after you graduate, you'll wake up in the morning (or the afternoon) and for maybe the first time in 7 months you'll find yourself not having a project due, a lesson to attend or intermission work to procrastinate on doing.

The goal of this assignment is to prepare you mentally for the change and to give you some tools to stay on track to be successful in your first year of life as a developer.

The lesson will be divided into sections for things to do if you are looking at:

- Job Hunting
- Starting A Job
- Repeating Module 4

## Deliverables

At the end of the assignment - you will need to submit your own 'Plan' - by using the template in this folder. Take the pieces from the template that are relevant to what will happen to you next Monday.

While this isn't required for the Portfolio review and your responses _will not_ affect you graduating, you should include it in your portfolio and we'll talk about it.

If you would prefer your plan not be a public document, create it as a private gist and DM it to your instructor, letting them know not to include it directly in the portfolio.

## The Main Profile

(Include the results of the assignments you have completed.)

## Job Hunting

### Job Stalking Assignment

(good for those still searching for a job)

There's an old saying - every company in tech is either hiring or in danger of going belly up.

There's another old saying - literally every tech company wants a senior developer with 5 years of experience in a framework that's a year old.

Do _not_ wait to pursue a company just because you haven't seen them post a 'Looking for a Junior Developer' ad. You'll be waiting a long time.

Instead - complete this assignment:

List 5 companies you might want to apply for
  - 2 companies you think you'd like to work for
  - 2 companies you don't really want to work for but that have a job postings somewhere you'd like to live
  - 1 dream company (BaseCamp, Funny or Die, Github... somewhere it's hard to get hired but wouldn't that be cool, eh?)

Don't say which is which though - just list 5.

For each company, answer the following questions:

- Do you know anyone that works there?
- Do you know if any Turing/gSchool/Hungry Academy grads work there?
- Link to the company's Github page(s)
  - List any open source projects actively maintained (have commits in the last 6 months)?
- List the tech stack of the company
  - You can find the tech stack in a few different ways
    - Find their current and past job postings
    - Look around their Github page
    - Read through their blog posts
    - Look at the LinkedIn profiles or Twitter pages or Meetup Profiles of current employees
- Divide the tech stack into:
  - tech you've worked with
  - tech you're familiar with
  - tech you know almost nothing about
- List any meetups and events they have recently or will soon sponsor
  - You can figure this out for searching for the company on eventbrite, meetup.com, reading through their blog and their twitter feed, etc.
- List any technical interview information you can find about the company
  - Find the company on GlassDoor
  - Try googling 'Company Name Technial Interview Questions'
- List 'pros' and 'cons' of working for this Company
  - e.g. Pros: They're in the green energy field / Cons: They have bad reviews on Glassdoor

Now that you have a profile on five companies, you're armed with a lot of different ways to get them to notice you. You may also find that a company you were 'meh' about is actually sounding better and better the more you learn about it.

... which leads us to...

### Not Passing Module 4 _is not the same as failing_.

I repeat, Not Passing Module 4 _is not the same as failing_.

[Zach put it best in this tweet](https://twitter.com/holman/status/706006896273063936)

What we're asked you to do in Module 4 is:
  - Learn a new language
  - Become better at using that language than many people who get paid to write it
  - Work with ambiguity
  - Do all of the above while not burning out after ~5 months of going really hard

It's not an easy module for everyone, and there are some incredible developers who have graduated from Turing after repeating Module 4.

If you made it to Module 4, you are a developer. Full stop. Don't doubt yourself.

However, if you are facing the possibility of not passing right now, you have two options to consider:

**Repeating Module 4 or Completing the Program without Graduating**

#### The 'Self Evaluation' Assignment

The entire staff wants you to graduate.

Identify the Reasons You Feel You Struggled This Module

- Have You Scheduled a Time with Jorge/Allison to Discuss Financial Implications of Repeating?
  - If you have financial concerns about repeating a module, this should be your first step.
-

Module 4 is when your family and friends start to expect things from you, and when your bank account starts to actively cry.
