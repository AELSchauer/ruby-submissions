## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Build a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- have a 'Jorge Mode'
- The bird will be replaced by our good friend Jorge
- Have a boost mode that occurs when eating beans and/or burritos
- Use audio integration for Jorge's catch phrases i.e. 'Wrap up people!'
- High score tracking
- [post ideas you have here](https://github.com/robbielane/flappy-bird/issues)

### What have you accomplished so far?

- we basically have full flappy bird functionality which includes:
- use spacebar or click to make bird 'flap'
- collision tracking for pipes and ground
- end-game sequence
- score tracking
- We finished all three goals from our last check-in with Meeka, plus visual representation of score.

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

- is our end game sequence OK? i.e. breaking into another game loop
- extra points? ðŸ˜¬
