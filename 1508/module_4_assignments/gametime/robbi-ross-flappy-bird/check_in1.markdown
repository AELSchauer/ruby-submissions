## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Build a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game
- The bird will be replaced by our good friend Jorge

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- Have a boost mode that occurs when eating beans and/or burritos
- Use audio integration for Jorge's catch phrases i.e. 'Wrap up people!'
- High score tracking
- [post ideas you have here](https://github.com/robbielane/flappy-bird/issues)

### What have you accomplished so far?

- We are able to render a .png on the canvas
- We have a few basic functions that define movement i.e. moveUp, moveDown
- The character falls continually, only a spacebar press will cause it to move up
- Working on rotate
