## Next Steps?
​
### What do you feel the next steps should be?
We think that the next steps should be to end the game when the snake moves outside of the
borders. After that, maybe we can make the snake bigger by appending the food.

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
​Collisions and grids.
