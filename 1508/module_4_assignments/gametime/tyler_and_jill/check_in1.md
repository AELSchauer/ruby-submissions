## The Plan

Different images for different pellets
Game is over is snake hits the wall
Add mp3 to play while game is going
Crazy mode- speed and color of snake changes


### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?
If the snake hits itself, the game ends

### What have you accomplished so far?
One pixel moves to the right on the screen and then goes away.
2 passing tests
