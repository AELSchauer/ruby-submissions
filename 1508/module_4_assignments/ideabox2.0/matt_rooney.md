# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[My Good Code](https://github.com/MattRooney/ideabox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/editIdea.js)
#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?
Because edit was easily the hardest of the crud functionality, and after I got past this I understood how
to approach the rest of the project much more clearly. Though it needs some refactoring.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[My bad code](https://github.com/MattRooney/ideabox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/thumbsUpDown.js)

#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
These two functions work and I feel like they work well. I'm proud that I got them to work but, the code is ugly. If else if else always makes
me feel guilty. Also, I know it can be refactored but I just ran out of time.
### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

Whatever my points total ends up being, I feel like I learned a LOT from this project.
