## Completion

### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes! I am happy to say that I successfully implemented Base Functionality and delivered a use-able product.

#### If not, list what functionality is missing.

### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

Inline-Editing. I personally think that this was easier than implementing a form for each idea.

### Attach a .gif, or images of any extensions work being used on the site.
