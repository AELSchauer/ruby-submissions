### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
https://github.com/sekharp/ideabox_js/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideabox.js#L106-L129
#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I enjoyed that I was able to figure out the multiple layers of issues debugging this code and using our new debugging skills/tools. There were javascript problems, database issues and more, and now it works perfectly!

#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
I really felt this could've been consolidated into one, but I did not get it done in time.
