## Completion

### Were you able to complete what you feel is the base functionality?

I was not able to figure out how to use schedule a poll to close. I have since found out that
there is an [npm scheduler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule). This would have been handy.

# Code Quality

#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?

[look at this socket stufff](https://github.com/adamki/real-time/blob/master/server.js#L59-L79) It's so cool!!! im only proud of this in the sense that
if is my "very first websocket". Other than that, it is not terribly exceptional.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
[testing!!!!](https://github.com/adamki/real-time/blob/master/test/server-test.js)

This testing didn't start until such a late time. I just didn't really get it down like I had hoped. It was rushed, and not excellent testing.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
