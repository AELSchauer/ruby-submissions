       notes: Some views are instantiating new objects within them. Need to pull out logic down the stack. Only on one page - so score is still 3 but should be aware it's not good practice. Scores for views and business logic are threes, but were close to twos because of the business logic in views.

       notes: One issue - mentioned above - Views are clean and contain no logic. Server(controller) is really clean. Great use of poros. Error page can be more specific to the issue.
