## Evaluation Rubric:

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

*   3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

*   2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

*   3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

### 4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

*   3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

### 5. Functional Expectations

*   2: Application is usable but has some missing functionality.
