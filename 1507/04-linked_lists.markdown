## With Jeff

### Michael Wong

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/Kealii/LinkedLists.git

#### Notes

* Seemed conceptually easy but hard to get started
* Didn't quite get remove by value working
* 42 tests with two issues around remove by value
* Tests show really good spiraling of complexity
* Implementation takes iterative approach
* Implementation is clear but some spots could use refactoring/simplification
* Make sure to reuse functionality that's already built

#### Scores

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping / Recursion: 3

### Nicole Hall

#### Notes

* 23 tests, all pass
* All methods work
* Tried for 2-3 tests per feature
* Tests are clear and make sense
* Implementation is solid but using Enumerable is a bit of a reach

#### Scores
