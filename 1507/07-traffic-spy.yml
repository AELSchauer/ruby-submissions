      notes:
        * Some better separation of tests could be used.
        * Some methods were very long
        * Some lines > 80 characters
        * Would like to have seen better breaking out of view into partials.
        * 275 assertions, test coverage was 98 percent 65 tests
        * Design was clean
        * Worked as advertised.

      notes:
        * Good pulling out of things into partials
        * Methods in controller were a little heavy and could stand to be
        refactored
        * Good use of helper classes, would like to have seen more
        * More logic could be pushed to the models
        * design was pleasant
        * JSon works, and campaigns work
        * 38 tests
