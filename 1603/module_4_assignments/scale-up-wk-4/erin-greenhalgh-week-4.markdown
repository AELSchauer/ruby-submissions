### Blog draft

- [Blog outline](https://gist.github.com/ErinGreenhalgh/71e801666c3d8855ab227f24e46ad020)
**Note:** This blog is unrelated to my work for LookingFor, but it is a topic of great interest to me (machine learning), and I plan to use this blog in my job search to demonstrate my interest in the topic and my learning process.

### Hours

Document your general hours below (or planned hours)

- Pre-Work (1 to 3 hours): 1
- Tuesday (8 hours): 7
- Wednesday (8 hours): 5
- Thursday (8 hours): 4
- Friday (8 hours): 4 (more to be completed)
- Weekend (0 hours):
**Notes:** This week I have been putting in a lot of hours for the job search, including doing research, setting up coffee meetings, working on my resume and business cards, and meeting with my mentor. I feel like it's worth the time now to get some setup going, especially before Denver Startup Week, so I have not logged the full amount of hours this week. I may be able to make up the hours over the weekend, but my priority will be on preparing for the final assessment.

### Participation

I have attended all the group standups and given feedback to Lucy's syntax questions in slack.
