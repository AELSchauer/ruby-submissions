# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

Over the course of Scale Up, I did a focused research spike on using Vapor, a web development framework written entirely in Swift.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

Prior to this week, I had absolutely zero experience with Swift. I had never seen it's syntax or a code sample. By the end, I was able to comprehend and write rudimentary Swift code in the context of Vapor.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

Unfortunately, PR's were an area I really slacked on during the course of this project. Between balancing Startup Week and working on something that I had experience in, I wasn't able to find something to really ask for input on. Its definitely something I hope to improve on in the future.

That said, I did use PR's whenever I added a new feature, and documented them appropriately. I also browsed other's PR's for input and inspiration on what I could do better in the future.


### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

I enjoyed having stand ups during this project. It was interesting being able to keep tabs on other projects, share our experiences, and overall felt a little more professional than past projects at Turing.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Between Startup Week, Job Search, and the volatility of Vapor itself, this project presented a strange set of challenges for me. In the past, I had been able to dedicate lots of time to just plowing through challenges with a new code base, but I was not able to do that here. The state of the framework I was using was constantly changing, with methods and classes sometimes phasing out on a daily basis.  I often found myself spending time researching things more than actually implementing, which was definitely strange and different.

Overall, I think my project deliverables transitioned drastically and while that was not intended, I am grateful to the experience, because I feel it is something I will definitely have to deal with again later in my career.
