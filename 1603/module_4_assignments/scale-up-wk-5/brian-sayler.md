### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks
- Worked on fixing a high-priority bug involving the Express server and React-Router. Issue was resolved and closed with a reviewed PR.
- Looked at converting some jQuery AJAX requests to using a promise-based HTTP library called axios.  Issue is still open but PR is up and production-ready.
- While looking at reducign the use of jQuery, I also researched how we could clean up some dependencies and improve performance. Issue remains open but a PR is in the works.

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.

- My prework consisted mostly of playing around with React in Lovisa's 'creact' tutorial.
- I worked through converting some of the AJAX requests to using fetch and promises during the prework.
- The creact tutorial bundled React views onto a Rails application, so I enjoyed learning about the differences between implementing React views inside a Rails application, as well as working with React as a separate application in the lookingFor project.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

- I really liked my experience receiving feedback on PR's.  It was an opportunity to showcase and explain what I was doing, as well as to document my process in solving problems.
- Previous students on the project commented on my PR's, and I really liked getting their perspective or jumping in to answer questions brought up by teammates.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

- Standups were mostly helpful for me to clarify what I should be prioritizing each day.
- I also enjoyed hearing about what other people were working on and their experiences going to Denver Startup Week events 
- Standups were also a good time to give each other gentle feedback on the process or to request an extra set of eyes.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

- I'd like to see the project get a makeover in the styling department.
- Also excited to see what Robbie has done with his visualizations using D3, there are some really cool graphs that could be iterated on in the future.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

- Can I continue making contributions to the project after Scale-Up? I'd like to finish some of the work that I've started up but haven't had a chance to merge in yet.
- Did the Scale Up project suffer because of Denver Start Up week from the persepctive of the instructors? I felt like we weren't able to move as quickly as I expected because of all the events going on.
- Another comment: why can't we make a culture of instructors giving code-reviews on Github when evaluating projects? I think it would be cool to have notes on Github documenting actionable items that students could work on to improve their applications.
