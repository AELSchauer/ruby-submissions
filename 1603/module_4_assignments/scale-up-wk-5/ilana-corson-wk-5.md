# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

- Fully polished Turing Arcade - I thought this was going to be a quick process but I found that when polishing, it took more time to get it exactly production ready.
- Met with Ellen Mary Hickman about my new role as a TA at Turing. We spoke about how to be effective at student support and she gave me some to-do's.
- Did a portion of the Code Academy React Tutorial
- Attended classes that were important to me as a community member and developer
- Attended Denver Startup Week events. Mostly about diversity in tech.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

- Accessibility is a lot bigger problem on websites than I thought. It was upsetting but motivating to see how to change a website to become ADA accessible. I also went to a lot of DSW events and learned about the Denver Tech community.
