# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks
I converted almost all of the views in my mod 3 personal project to React. 

### Link(s) to Your Work

 - [Github](https://github.com/AnnaCW/m3_personal_project/tree/react-dev-1)
 - All of my React work is on a branch called "react-dev-1." I have not merged the react dev branch into master or pushed it to production.

### Hours logged this week?

- Monday (0 hours): .5
- Tuesday (8 hours): 5

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
I didn't know about ESLint, which makes a big difference in helping to clean up files in a syntax I'm still learning. I also knew about but didn't really know how to use 'setState' to update page content. After this week, I really have an appreciation of how powerful and efficient React can be.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
It was interesting to review PRs involving unfamiliar material and/or languages, though I wasn't able to offer specific suggestions. I also didn't receive much specific feedback, but it was a helpful exercise to open a PR knowing that it would be (or at least might be) reviewed by someone not familiar with the project.  

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
Since everyone or almost everyone was working on something different, it was good to have this brief daily contact to stay in touch and know what others were working on. I like that we had such a variety of projects.   

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
