# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

I completed the barebones of a React/Redux app that allows a user to view interview questions about JavaScript. It took me a long time to set up the app and figure out how to get everything running locally, but now I have the basics of a functional app that can be run locally with gulp to compile. Coming from a background where I was used to using a local server, I found the whole setup process quite confusing, and ended up going through multiple tutorials and techniques in an attempt to get it functional. Finally, I have done so. It is nowhere near the point where it would be a great portfolio piece.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

I was much more confused about how to bring a React app together than I am now. I also was forced to learn quite a bit of ES6 syntax in this week.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

I got a few comments on my PR that I submitted to the Slack channel; not a ton, but a little. I enjoyed submitting PR comments when I had them, which I did for Ilana and Charlie's this week, as well as some last week. It was interesting to look at what the team projects were working on and how they were reviewing content together.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

The standups were interesting when people attended, and I liked that we were all working on different projects, so we heard about different things that everyone was working on and were exposed to (at least in terms of familiarizing us with the terms of) new tech terminology. This last week, due to Denver Startup Week, I did feel that attendance significantly dropped, though.
