# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks
I've read through and worked to understand all aspects of the JavaScript and React Airbnb linting rules. As a team, we have voted on which rules we do not want to be part of the project, and wish to override. I've documented my research for this issue in a basecamp document, and noted this in the issue number 64 on github. I was also a participant in Denver Start Up Week where I spent a lot of my time listing to talks on everything from algorithms to accessibility. 

### Link(s) to Your Work

 LookingFor: I've added a link to basecamp with research and decisions made as well as how to proceed.

 See basecamp for document on which rules have been vetoed/how to set up ESlint

 DSW Deliverable: My deliverable for DSW was to get at least 3 strong job leads/coffee/or follow ups. I'm happy to say that I have two strong job leads as a result of the job fair and am following up for coffee with another lead.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
  Because a large part of my week this week was attending lectures during DSW I feel like I know a crazy ton more than I did at the beginning of the week. One of the more interesting talks I went to was about security for start ups. The speakers discussed many common security issues that face start ups and larger companies alike. One of the most interesting things they mentioned was that if an attacker gets into your network, typically they are not discovered for 200 days or longer.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
  I did not personally have a PR so I haven't gotten any feedback for it just yet. I enjoy doing PR reviews however. It's a cool way to experience what everyone did. I enjoyed seeing Charlie's python code. It looked very similar to ruby, though I wanted to comment on all the method blocks that they were missing an "end". I did feel like I had more to contribute to code that was written in React though.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
  I did remote daily stand ups. This was great for me because of DSW and I appreciated having the ability to still participate, however, I did miss out on what every one else was dealing with during the week. It is hard to do a remote standup in that format, I felt like I didn't know what was going on with the rest of the LookingFor team.
