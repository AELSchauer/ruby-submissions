### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
*  I made an effort to learn as much as I could about React and Electron over the past two weeks.  While I didn't implement as many features as I would have liked into my project, my understanding of React and Electron's APIs certainly became deeper.  I hope to continue pursuing these frameworks/libraries in future projects and continue to iterate on this project as well.

### Link to blog post(s)
[Blog Post](https://medium.com/@npisciotta/a-beginners-attempt-at-github-s-electron-6fe001ab561#.w4wmsww0z)
### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
* I certainly found all feedback I received to be helpful--mainly the comments on JS syntax.  I didn't have a lot of code to review, and most people aren't familiar with Electron, but there were still some helpful comments.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
* I enjoyed daily stand ups.  It was good to have an understanding of where everyone was at in their projects, and share with others my struggles and successes for my project.
