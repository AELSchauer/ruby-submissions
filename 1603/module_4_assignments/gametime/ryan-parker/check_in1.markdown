## Basics

### Team
- [Ryan Batty](https://github.com/riizu)
- [Parker Phillips](https://github.com/ExCaelum)

### Game Name

Seven Levels of Code 

### Basic Description

The player is presented with a procedurally generated "program" made up of seven levels of abstraction that are filled with malicious bugs, vulnerabilities, and exploits. They must make their way through the program, eventually clearing it for release.

- A movable player
- Basic flow of: Spawn -> Navigate -> Reach Exit -> Repeat
- Enemies (kill player on contact, no actual combat)
- Smooth movement
- Full collision detection with walls, exits, and enemies

### What have you accomplished so far?

- Planning and discussion
- DTR
- Repo and Waffle Creation
- Initial procedural generation research

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

# Instructor Feedback Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)

* 50: First check in form and README was completed and pull requested in. Team has a well documented plan for moving forward with their game. Team has completed some wireframing and/or written code.
* 40: First check in form and README was completed and pull requested in. Team has a well documented plan for moving forward with their game. Team has not written any code or created any wireframe documents.
* 25: First check in form completed but shows little effort at documenting/planning and team has not written any code.
* 0: First check in form was not completed.

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

* Goal 1: _eg. Create snake head constructor that draws itself on the canvas_

* Goal 2: _eg. Stop snake from moving past the boundry of the canvas when moving - write tests_

* Goal 3: _eg. Configure jshint and .jshintrc_

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_

### Stretch Goals

* _ie. Goals that are not required to meet the checkin, but would be good to have. Completion may result in extra credit points_
