Notes:

- controllers, views, models, are great.
- there is no logic in the views
- group was comfortable using partials, presenters, and poros to remove logic
- group committed to doing the difficult thing of keeping logic only in the models
- multiple levels of tests.
- group could work on usability/seeding data
- application was functional
