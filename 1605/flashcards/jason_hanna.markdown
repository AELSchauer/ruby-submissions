Notes:

* Solid project -- shows competent manipulation of ruby fundamentals -- demonstrating much greater comfort and proficiency
defining classes, defining methods, manipulating instance variables, etc etc
* Testing, especially on the Round class is looking really good -- shows a strong progression from very simple examples up
to more complex ones
* looked at a couple of small style points here and there but overall style looks clean, methods are short and readable,
relying on ruby idioms in good ways

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
