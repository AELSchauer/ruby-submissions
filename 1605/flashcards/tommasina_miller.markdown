Notes:

* Looking solid with Ruby fundamentals and basic OOP mechanics
* Seem comfortable defining classes, methods, working with ivars, interacting between multiple classes
* testing is looking good -- seem to have main concepts down and be executing on them -- keep an eye on edge cases
and making sure we test each scenario with a few different inputs
* Round class was quite concise and well-implemented; talked about a few ways to possibly make it even simpler by
avoiding tracking duplicative information in multiple instance variables
* Doing this will make the code a little leaner and also give us better paths to testing some of this logic

Scores:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
