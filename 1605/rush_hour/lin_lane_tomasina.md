## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

turned in Wednesday the refactored work. All the refactored code was commented out, but when I changed it it worked.

* 2.5: Application fulfills base expectations   
* 2.5: Application has some small missing base functionality

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

#### Workflow (NOT GRADED)

* 2: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.
