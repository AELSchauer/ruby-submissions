Notes:
* All functionality is there. Great job on taking a risk and getting vue.js
 working
* Some gaps in the UI, quick fixes will make it awesome
* Tests are great, good to see a large percentage of code being tested
* Code is generally broken out well, but would like to see longer methods broken
 out more and making more POROs to single out responsibilities
