Assessed By: Horace

## Notes

* Good project, completed expectations and also reversed the html->md process
* Shows good extraction of various conversion types into new objects
* showing good use of ruby tools and data structures to handle various conversions concisely and efficiently
(good enums, using lots of the good String manipulation methods)
* small thing but would like to see methods broken out in the main "runner" class
* Testing is looking good; could possibly have a few more; could test each piece in isolation as well

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 3. Functionality

* 4: Application implements all base functionality and two extensions

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
