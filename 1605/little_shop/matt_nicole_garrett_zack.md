Notes:
* All features are implemented with two extensions
* Refactor flash messages
* Validate association not foreign_key
* Controllers look good - small refactorings
* Models look really good
* Missing some model test coverage
* Workflow looks good - need to delete branches after using

## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

### 1. Feature Completeness

* 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions

### 2. Views

* 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through

### 3. Controllers

* 3.5
/* * 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack */
/* * 3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts */

### 4. Models

* 4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features

### 5. Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

### 6. Usability

* 4: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers

### 7. Workflow

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
