Notes:
* 17 tests, all passing
* Remember in the future to make sure that you are separating out tests into their individual files
* Tests hould only test one method, dont depend on to_string to verify that data is where it should be - reach in and grab and check what you need to.
* List append should only take a single item, the JB wrapper should handle splitting it up.
* Pull the splitting duties out to JB, LL should only handle singl eitems

Scores:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style


* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion
