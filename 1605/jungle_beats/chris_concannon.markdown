Notes:
* 23 tests, all passing.
* Did some recursion as well, remember to not use instance variables with recursion, anything you need to maintain state of you should pass as an argument.
* Good testing, make sure you are testing both sad paths, and making sure that any "hard" code in your implementation will let your small tests pass.
*
