Notes:
* 21 tests - raises an error during test as intended.
* next time, place tests in a test directory, and code files in a lib directory.
* Write more descriptive test names
* each class should have its own file where the name of the file matches the class
* good iterative implementation in looping methods
* Remember that you can get all of your getter methods for free with attr_reader
* Lean more on your debugging tools instead of puts driven development.
* good way to develop good style - check out http://houndci.com or rubocop
