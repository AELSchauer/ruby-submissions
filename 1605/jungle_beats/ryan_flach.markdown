Notes:
* 50 tests
* Look closer at what youre testing, check for ways you can change code that breaks the intent of the program but still allows tests to pass.
* JB has a REPL
* Used both recursive and iterative approaches.
* Try to use some better method names, and you dont have to go all the way refactoring small things, clarity is king.
