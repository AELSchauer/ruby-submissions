* I do not like this code due to the multiple responsibilities that this method has. This method can be refactored into a different ajax call function, and the if statements can be put into one function that determines the output. It's incredibly sloppy, but accomplishes the job in the time frame.


### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
