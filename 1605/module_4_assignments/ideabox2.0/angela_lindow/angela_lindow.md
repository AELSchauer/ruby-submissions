* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
 [editIdea](https://github.com/allindow/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/edit_idea.js#L5-L15)

 I'm proud of it because originally this whole JS file was very *not* DRY, and I wasn't going to bother with refactoring it because I felt like there was a lot going on. I decided to try it, and in the process got more practice traversing the DOM. I think the each loops could have been pulled out into separate functions, too, but I'm happy that I got to this point.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
[getIdeas](https://github.com/allindow/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/get_all_ideas.js#L1-L17)

Clearly all of this is commented out. I wouldn't say I don't feel awesome about it because I think the implementation is ok, and it worked when I was in the browser. However, it made a majority of my tests fail because with Selenium, it wasn't getting the ideas to load to the page for some reason. I tinkered around for quite a while but wasn't able to figure it out, so I left in my original code in index.html.erb where I'm iterating through `@items` on the initial page load.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
