I was only able to build part of this feature. I tried to use on.('change'), but didn't get there with it and ran out of time.
https://github.com/deborahleehamel/idea_box/blob/more_testing/spec/features/user_can_delete_idea_spec.rb#L10
Not able to get capybara to click on a specific "Delete" button. Tried passing selectors and/or my specific idea.id within, using find and match examples to click on "Delete" button.


### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
