# Scale Up - Chris Concannon

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks
I built two Android Apps - one following a tutorial, and the other of my own design. I initially had planned to make my custom app do an API call to the Giphy API, but I realized that I was in over my head with my understanding of the way Fragments and Activities mesh. I opted to present an iteration on my tutorial-based API as a PR for review. The PR Review encompassed adding screen-rotation response to my app.

I learned a lot about Android App development, and I have decided this is something I will continue to learn.

I participated in many blog reviews (5-6 by my count) and several PR reviews (1 in week 1, 2 in week 2). These were all good experiences, but they left me wishing that I had familiarity with the topics. As I was pursuing Android app development without a team environment, I felt disconnected from the work in most blog posts and reviews. I contributed what I could, however, and I was at least able to give advice from the perspective of someone that understands the organizational principles behind what my peers are doing, but doesn't know the particulars of their chosen language. I think my comments were useful and well-received.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
Before this week, I did not know about nesting LinearLayout and RelativeLayout views within an Android Activity Screen. The views essentially allow you to construct either linear or relational views (e.g. put things in corners, along edges, matching sides together, etc.) in an Android App, and they are the foundation for all app views.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
Doing a PR Review was a humbling experience because I put my code in front of Turing alums/mentors (Bob Gu) with Android experience. I was given StackOverflow links in return which addressed issues with my PR. It was also nice that I was given this feedback, because it shows that real developers are sympathetic to what I'm trying to achieve.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
Honestly, I think they were not so great with Whiskey Tango. I could see them being relevant if everyone had interest in the tasks that others were completing, but in the context of Whiskey Tango it seemed like a source to vent frustrations and waste the time of most of the other students - nothing productive really came from them during week 2.
