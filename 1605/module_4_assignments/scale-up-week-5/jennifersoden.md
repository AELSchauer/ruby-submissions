# Scale Up Submission Form - Open Source Projects

## Basics

### Link(s) to the PRs or Issues You Picked Up

### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks
I really tried to understand the project we were working on, learn React, and work/communicate with 6 other people. I did a lot more reading than coding, and attempting to give feedback on things that I knew little about. I feel as though I haven't produced much, but that I've learned a good amount about my personal strengths and weaknesses to brownfielding, working with a bigger team, and reviewing others' work. I did learn some React, but I'm still not comfortable with it.

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
I didn't realize how much time can be spent not coding and still feel like I'm doing something.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback (links are nice)
I found that I'm pretty bad at it if I'm not involved in the project. I looked at several PRs but didn't think I could provide meaningful feedback to their code because I found it difficult to understand what was going on. The PRs I did see within the team, I felt like I understood but didn't see a need to comment on because things were clear and I didn't see anything wrong. On this project, I worked with Zack for a PR and I researched with Jason but nothing came of it, so I did not get any PRs reviewed because I did not make any.

### Discuss: your experience doing blog and getting feedback (links are nice)

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I enjoyed daily stand ups. I feel as though if I had a smaller team it would change my opinion of them a lot though

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?
I'd like to see the mailer implemented. I looked into it with Jason, but neither of us had a solid understanding of how to do it and what was going on. I think it would be a neat feature.
