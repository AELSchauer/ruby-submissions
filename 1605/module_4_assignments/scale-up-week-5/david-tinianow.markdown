# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

During the first week, I worked through the first few chapters of the Head First Java book.  I completed some basic Java exercises, did an exercism, and began research on the differences between Java and Ruby as object-oriented programming languages.

During the second week, I continued to make progress in the Head First Java book.  I completed some more extensive exercises, including a basic Battleship tutorial.  I began to learn about more advanced concepts like polymorphism in Java. I also spent a lot of time researching the differences between Java and Ruby and ended up writing such a thorough blog post that it will have to be split into two parts.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

I dug pretty deep into some of the differences between Java and Ruby as I researched my blog post.  I learned about:
- Interpretted vs Compiled Code
     - Compiled code is converted to another language to be read, while interpreted code is read directly
- Strongly vs Weakly Typed Languages
     - Strongly typed languages check the type of a variable, while weakly typed might coerce types instead of failing at runtime
- Dynamic vs Static
     - Dynamic languages don't care about variable type declaration, while static languages will not work without type

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback (links are nice)
- [PR review for Zack](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/pull/88)

- [PR review for Trent](https://github.com/Caleb9193/brotha_nature_api/pull/3#pullrequestreview-7340219)

It was tough to give good feedback since many projects were in React and I was not familiar with that syntax.  I did my best to find code I was familiar with and comment on that.

I did not submit a PR myself, since most of the work I completed were exercises from the Head First Java book and had solutions printed.

### Discuss: your experience doing blog reviews and getting feedback (links are nice)

- Blog review for Matt P: I really like how much detail you go into about your learning process. This made it easy to follow your journey and progression while learning Swift. I especially like that you talk about what resources did and did not work for you, which I think will be useful for others trying to learn Swift. My constructive feedback would be to consider adding another section at the end to briefly summarize your key takeaways and perhaps allude to how you can continue to develop this project or your new Swift skills in the future.

- Blog review for Ryan:  Your examples are really clear and succinct and your explanations make it easy to understand even for someone who has never seen Elixir before.  I like that you were able to take a complex topic and make it digestible for other programmers.  Breaking the article down into five different bullet points helps with this, since everyone loves a good list article.  I donâ€™t really have any constructive feedback to offer - this is a really solid blog post. Nice work.

I enjoyed reading others blogs and learning about their learning experience during Scale Up.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

I thought it was helpful to do stand-ups to help keep us accountable for our work.  The Whiskey Tango group was a bit large though.  I think it would have been better if the group split into two, so we would be more accountable to others rather than simply going through the motions of reporting on our progress.

##### Modifiers

Modifiers cannot take you below 0 points for the section

* -10 points: Developer is unable to speak to work completed

### Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)

Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

* 40: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
* **30: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature whose next steps are not well documented.**
* 10: Developers attempted to implement extensions using technologies not covered in class but it did not result in code or documentation.
