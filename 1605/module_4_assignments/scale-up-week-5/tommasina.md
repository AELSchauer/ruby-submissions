# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

 I've extensively researched campaign finance, the openFEC API, data visualization tools, and React integrations. I created an app called FECensus which allows users to view data related to the presidential candidates' campaign fundraising. First, users can view a list of individual contributions raised by each candidate by state. My goal was to render this data in a choropleth map, but I wasn't able to integrate the map in time. Next, users can view the total individual contributions each candidate has raised to date. Finally, users are able to submit their zip code to see an aggregate individual contribution total for each candidate. I spent a lot of time this weekend looking for tutorials in React on how to use data visualization tools within React, but couldn't connect all of the pieces in time.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

I learned even more about the wild world of data visualization. I learned more recently (and too late) that most D3 libraries have specific npm modules for React integration since it can be challenging otherwise. I learned more recently about Chart.js and Leaflet, both of which would have been excellent options for my visualizations. Datamaps, the option I spent the most time working on, has terrible documentation. I learned what choropleth means ("a map that uses differences in shading, coloring, or the placing of symbols within predefined areas to indicate the average values of a property or quantity in those areas") and that I wanted to use this particular kind of map.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback (links are nice)
I reviewed Caleb, Matt Campbell, and Roberta's PRs. I mostly asked a few questions to gauge whether or not they were doing what I thought they were each doing in their code. I caught a few typos, I believe, so I hope that's helpful. I'm still trying to figure out what's happening in Caleb's code with Axios not seeing the first post that he's creating, but I'm still engaged in that process.  

### Discuss: your experience doing blog reviews and getting feedback (links are nice)
I reviewed Lane and Matt Campbell's blog posts. I mostly reviewed them for readability and found the narratives in each to be especially compelling compared to others I had read. I let them know this, and provided some other feedback. As an old English major and grad TA, this sort of reviewing is much more natural for me than reviewing code that I'm unfamiliar with. I'm stating this as a benchmark for myself: I want to get better at code review. 

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I thought it was helpful to hear how much progress others were making. I felt a sense of solidarity in their process, struggling with new material, burn out and balancing excitment for their progress with the job search. 

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
Do you think we could look at my map to see why I couldn't get it working? I spent so long on it, and feel like a failure for not getting it.
