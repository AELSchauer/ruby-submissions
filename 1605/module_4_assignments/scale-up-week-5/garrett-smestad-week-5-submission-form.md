# Scale Up Submission Form (Week 5) - Open Source Projects

## Basics

### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks

The first week was mostly spent familiarizing myself with the project and its code. I did a lot of research during the first week. Most of it was related to various job board websites' APIs to determine whether or not they could be integrated into the project. However, I also began brainstorming ideas for my blog post(s), and settled on the topic of React vs. Ember.js. I quickly discovered this was a fairly large undertaking, as the two are significantly different and I would have to learn a good deal of Ember.js on my own in order to accurately and thoroughly speak to the differences between the two. This actually ended up consuming a large portion of my time during the second week.

During the second week, I ended up landing a job interview as well as a follow-up interview the next day. It was not the job I'd applied for, so in addition to losing time on the project for the two interviews themselves, I also had to spend time researching the job (i.e., roles, responsibilities, expectations, language(s), terms/vocabulary, etc.) so I wouldn't make a fool of myself during the interviews. That being said, during the second week I did additional research on React and Ember.js, wrote my blog post, documented the results from my API research, and reviewed a few pull requests.

### Hours logged this week?

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week

Where do I begin? Before this project, I didn't know anything about React, so I learned a lot from the [Creact Tutorial](https://github.com/applegrain/creact) that was part of the pre-work. I learned what React is, that it was created by Facebook, that it can be added to my existing Rails projects, and I now understand that it merely builds the view layer using JSX.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback (links are nice)

I really enjoyed the extensive collaboration on PRs during this project. Everyone was encouraged to review PRs from other projects (e.g., Whiskey Tango) as well as their own, which allowed for better feedback since "fresh eyes" tend to have a different perspective. It also provided a great learning experience, getting to see other people's code and how they chose to implement a solution.

### Discuss: your experience writing a blog post and getting feedback (links are nice)

I'm not very good at coming up with original ideas for a project, nor am I good at coming up with ideas for a blog post. When this project was assigned, the two OSS projects to choose from---LookingFor and MentorSHIP---utilized either React or Ember.js, respectively. With that choice still fresh in my mind, I decided to write a blog post that would compare React and Ember.js. I quickly discovered that I had embarked on a huge undertaking. Not only because the two are significantly different, but mostly because in order to discuss how the two compare, I would have to know and understand both fairly in depth. This meant that I had to learn Ember.js entirely on my own, as well as learn more about React.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

I found the daily stand-ups to be rather fruitless. They usually finished in less than 10  minutes because everyone was always in constant communication via Slack, GitHub (PRs/PR reviews), Basecamp, etc., so no one ever needed to speak in detail during the meetings about what they had done or what they were going to do. The benefit I do see from doing daily stand-ups is that it pushes you to complete a task quicker. Having to give an update on a daily basis makes you less inclined to stretch the completion of a task over multiple days, because nobody wants to tell the group the same thing each day when asked, "What did you do yesterday?" or "What are you currently working on?".

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

The ability to sign up for e-mail/text alerts when jobs are posted that match certain criteria (i.e., a specific language, a specific city/state).
