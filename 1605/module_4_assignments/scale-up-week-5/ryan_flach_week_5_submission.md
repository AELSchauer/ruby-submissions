# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks
Despite two pivots early on, the past two weeks encompassed a lot of learning in Elixir. Initially, I had explored a project in Go, which produced no real code. Next, I explored the project from the perspective of React, Firebase, and Webpack. This did produce some exploratory production code, but was ultimately not the direction I was interested in going. Finally, I spent the remaining time learning Elixir, eventually producing a simple CLI application that turns a user's input to speech. Additionally, two blog posts were produced, one of which was featured on and tweeted by The Practical Dev.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
I didn't know anything about Elixir prior to this week. A majority of this learning is outlined in [my second blog](https://medium.com/@ryanflach/fun-things-in-elixir-723f71c4b4a2#.c5kc69ijf). One thing that I found particularly interesting was the pipe operator, which elegantly allows function chaining, automatically passing the expression evaluation from the left of the pipe operator as the first argument to the function on its right.

### Discuss: your experience doing blog reviews and getting feedback (links are nice)
- I received excellent feedback from a number of my peers. Unfortunately, I did not save this feedback.
- I provided feedback to Matt Packer:
  ```
  General comments:
  - I like how you broke each section into paragraphs. Medium has a tool for specifying sub-headings, and I think that may look better than your current use of just bold text. You can move through your heading options by highlighting the text and using cmd + alt + 1 (bigger) or cmd + alt + 2 (smaller). This will also help your section sub-heading for your MVP to look less like a link.
  - My personal preference is to link something only in its first mention. This would allow you to remove several duplicate links and provide more of a readable flow, in my opinion.

  Scale Up:
  - Good introduction to the project at hand. As a minor grammatical suggestion, I think you could blend your second and third sentences together to more fluidly define the project. An example modification would be:
      - In the final Module at Turing, students are presented with Scale Up, where students choose to either work on a brownfield project or complete an independent study.

  Background:
  - To avoid describing Turing's module system, consider starting with "Earlier in my time at Turing, ...", rather than, "In Module three, ..."
  - Missing 'to' in the first sentence under MVP ("I always like have a plan.")

  Docs & Tutorials:
  - Really like that you linked your process with the docs and tutorials you used. Would make it really easy for others to follow your learning.

  Barriers:
  - Good job identifying and talking about a specific problem (the IDE) and the resources that helped you overcome it.
  - In paragraph 2 sentence 1, consider re-wording for clarity surrounding why Swift 2 was being used in most tutorials. One idea would be:
      - 'Because of the rapid development rate of Swift, most tutorials I found were written in the context of Swift 2. For this project, however, I was working with Swift 3.'

  Result:
  - AWESOME use of that GIF. Really tied everything together.
  ```
- I provided feedback to Chris Concannon:
  ```
  In paragraph 3 ('Open Android Studio...'), I think these steps could be made slightly easier to follow if expressed in a numbered list, since they are sequential steps.

  I personally find it helpful to see filenames and in-line code utilizing code markdown formatting. Medium allows in-line markdown now with backticks (`).

  LOVE your use of images throughout - really made it easy to follow your steps.

  Overall, I think you did a great job with this post. It was really easy to follow your steps. You narrowed down a lot of work into a concise tutorial.
  ```

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
- I found stand-ups to be a valuable means of having accountability for my own progress, and a good way of tracking the progress of my peers and getting ideas from their progress and blockers.
