# Game Time Check In # 3

## Instructor Goal Completion

### Goal 1: Finish collision detection and add desired reactions to obstacles and jeepney

  - [Link to low-quality GIF demonstrating reactions](http://recordit.co/UsaSotHR56)
  - Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
    - No, we followed the plan we originally started with.
  - Questions, Comments, Concerns?
    - Learned a lot about the starting x and y values for `drawImage()`!

### Goal 2: Start screen / end or restart game screen

  - [One-low quality GIF to rule them all (it's the same as the first one)](http://recordit.co/UsaSotHR56)
  - Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
    - No, but there is additional work that we'd like to do here.
  - Questions, Comments, Concerns?
    - None at this time.

### Goal 3: Scoring points and high score functionality

  - [One low-quality GIF to rule them all (it's the same as the first two)](http://recordit.co/UsaSotHR56)
  - Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
    - No.
  - Questions, Comments, Concerns?
    - None at this time.

### Goal 4 (stretch): Implement current health and current score accumulator

- [Really getting a lot of mileage out of this low-quality GIF](http://recordit.co/UsaSotHR56)
- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?

## Next Steps?

- Automatically increasing difficulty (speed)
- Revise game start/end to live entirely within the canvas, include instructions
- Add additional obstacle (street dog)
- Add bonus items (ability to earn back health / points if at full health)
- Add sound effects / music
- Beautify

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
- Pushing to GitHub Pages seems to lose all styling and JS. Solutions found on Google involve installing a dependency via npm, whereas previous iterations of Game Time seem to have not required this.

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

These goals should center around wrapping up the game:

 - Matching the [rubric](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown) requirements
 - Refactoring/Cleaning up test coverage
 - Making the game compelling for players
 - Making sure the README and other documentation is up to snuff
 - Making sure the game is deployed

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_
