# Game Time Check In # 3

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOAL 1: Random generation of enemies

[Random Generation](https://github.com/Automatic365/gametime/blob/canvas_collision/lib/game.js#L21-L34)

  - Did you deviate from the instructions?

      * No we did not deviate from the instructions.

### GOAL 2: Collision Detection

[Collision Detection](https://github.com/Automatic365/gametime/blob/canvas_collision/lib/game.js#L41-L67)

- Did you deviate from the instructions?

    * No we did not deviate from the instructions.

### GOAL 3: Score and Timer

[Score](https://github.com/Automatic365/gametime/blob/canvas_collision/lib/player.js#L1-L28)

- Did you deviate from the instructions?

    * I wouldn't say that we deviated but the goal was written as score and timer. But our score is calculated by the duration of time alive. That being said, we felt that is was redundant to have both on the screen.

### Stretch Goal: Start and End Screens

[Start/End](https://github.com/Automatic365/gametime/blob/timer/lib/game.js#L61-L67)

- Did you deviate from the instructions?

    * We currently have end page presenting your score and are working on a start/restart screen.

- Are we on the right track?

## Next Steps?

- Power ups
- Start screen

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

These goals should center around wrapping up the game:

 - Matching the [rubric](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown) requirements
 - Refactoring/Cleaning up test coverage
 - Making the game compelling for players
 - Making sure the README and other documentation is up to snuff
 - Making sure the game is deployed

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_
