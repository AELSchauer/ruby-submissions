# Game Time Check In # 2

## Instructor Goal Completion

![Game Current State](http://i.imgur.com/1aOCjF7.png)

### GOAL 1

* There are multiple enemies moving across the screen (canvas)

[enemy code](https://github.com/Automatic365/gametime/blob/player_movement/lib/enemy.js#L1-L37)

  - We did not deviate from instructions but we still need to create a loop with random values to generate enemies.

### GOAL 2

* There is a player (might not be moving)

[player code](https://github.com/Automatic365/gametime/blob/player_movement/lib/player.js#L1-L23)

- We did not deviate from instructions.

### Stretch Goal

* Player tracks mouse movement

[player code](https://github.com/Automatic365/gametime/blob/player_movement/lib/player.js#L15-L21)

- We did not deviate from instructions but we need to figure out how styling takes part in the location, we had to manipulate the calculation.

- Overall concern is that our requires do not work and we are having trouble pulling logic out of index.js.

## Next Steps?

- Loop for enemies
- Collision detection (enemies and canvas edge)
- Timer
- Score calculation/ local storage
- Level recognition
- Summary page
- Start button/page
- Power-ups
