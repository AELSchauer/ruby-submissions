## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product
- Game starts with player in opposite corner from AI.
- Player and AI can both drop bombs.
- Player drops bombs to break boxes to get to AI.
- Both Player and AI have unlimited number of bombs.
- AI drops bomb when breakable box is obstructing progress.
- AI is challenging enough to kill player.
- Three levels of difficulty, with a new grid each time.
- Power-ups for increase blast-radius for bombs.

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?
- User can drop bombs.
- AI that can drop bombs without killing self.
- Speed of AI increases with levels (same grid)
- Points added for each remaining second on clock.
- Player and AI can move in all four directions, unable to move past bombs and other tiles.
- Game ends when time is up or one person standing.

### What have you accomplished so far?
Unit testing Block properties.
Unit testing player movement functions.

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?
Somewhat concerned that AI functionality must be included for the MVP despite the fact it's listed as an extension.
