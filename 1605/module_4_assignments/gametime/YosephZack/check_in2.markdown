# Game Time Check In # 2

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOAL 1 - background scrolls infinitely and responds to arrow keys

- [Link to Code](https://github.com/zackforbing/game_time/blob/dfd25b16e2be80ef374143d82caf8c64784d2848/lib/index.js#L21)
- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
    The arrow keys don't work yet. we struggled with this one a bit, there isn't a lot of relevant info available online. I'm fairly certain it's within our capabilities, but we spent a lot of time just trying to get it scrolling, and we had to move on to our other Goals.
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?
    this feature is causing a rather large memory leak. scrolling through the image five times caused my system memory usage to skyrocket to 20GB. we would appreciate any input on how to reduce this.

### GOAL 2 - have a character shooting bullets

- [Link to Code](https://github.com/zackforbing/game_time/blob/1a9f287de09e5718da6e4534152450fe2f064f80/lib/player.js#L1)
- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
    We don't (as of 1:05pm) have bullets implemented yet due to spending a lot of time on the scrolling background, but we are working hard on it. we have a player drawn on the screen.
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?
    none at this time. we have just run out of time to implement the feature

### GOAL 3 - Create more cards from "create cards" cards

- [Link to Waffle](https://waffle.io/zackforbing/game_time)
- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
    nope. we got cards built for near everything we need now.
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?

### STRETCH GOAL - Enemies on the screen

- Provide a screenshot or gif or link to code for this goal
- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
    we do not have this implemented as of 1:05pm. but hopefully...
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?

## Next Steps?

  next steps will be getting the background to scroll correctly with the keys, enemy movement, and collision detection between player bullets and enemies.
