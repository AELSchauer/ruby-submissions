  - Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
    * Nope, we added our sprites!
  - Questions, Comments, Concerns?
    * We had a question about refactoring out our conditional to another method. Any advice?
  
## Next Steps?

- What do you feel the next steps should be?
  * We want to finish up our Health-o-meter
  * We have a lot of user playability functions to finish up (starting, progressing, and ending the game; storing scores, etc.)
  * We want to add in some feature tests. 
  
### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
  * Can we use jQuery's jque-meter? or other plug-ins?
  * We moved a lot of things into index.js but want to know how to test them. How should we go about that? What would you recommend before turning it in? 
  * What's going on with our sprites when we pull down a new branch? They keep disappearing but after some time they work consistently. Do we need to use on-load?

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

 - Refactoring/Cleaning up test coverage
 - Making the game compelling for players
 - Making sure the README and other documentation is up to snuff
 - Making sure the game is deployed

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_
