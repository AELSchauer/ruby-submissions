# Game Time Check In # 2

## Instructor Goal Completion

### Screenshot of Current Game State
![Screenshot of game on localhost at Checkin 2](figures/game-time-checkin-2.png)


### GOAL 1 - Full Functional Power Meter
  - [Power Meter Functionality](https://github.com/concach/game-time/blob/dev/lib/power-bar.js#L1-L33)
  - No deviations

### GOAL 2 - Log/Set Current Meter Values with Event Listener

- [Space Bar Triggering](https://github.com/concach/game-time/blob/dev/lib/index.js#L15-L49)
- Slight deviations - the player now holds down the space bar to start the meters. We thought this would be more engaging and precise gameplay
- Comments: We need to refactor this... help with organization of our gameplay, and opinions on how to break out all this functionality, would be much appreciated.

### GOAL 3 - Additional Styling

- see screenshot above
- No deviations
- Comments: Background image is hard-coded into css as background attribute. Is this the best way to do this?

## Next Steps?
- get the ball to disappear and signal the end of that turn when it hits the hole
- refactor code to many functions including: gameLoop, roundOfGolf, playHole, endRound, playerStroke, ballInHole, etc.

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
- Should we use RequireJS?
