# Game Time Check In # 1

## Basics

### Team
- [Jenny](https://github.com/msjennygiraffe)
- [Kerry](https://github.com/kjs222)

### Game Name

Binary Snake (pending...)

### Give a Basic Description of the Game

Learn to count in binary through Skake...

Snake eats 0s or 1s in the correct order (i.e. translating a provided decimal number to binary)
Snake grows for each correct 1/0 eaten
Snake dies (or loses a life) if it eats the wrong number or runs into itself


### Include a Link to or Screen Shot of the Game

Our game?  It doesn't really exist yet...

## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

e.g.

- A decimal number is provided
- Snake moves around screen
- Snake tries eat 0s and 1s in correct order to translate the decimal to binary
  - When a correct number is eaten, the snake grows in length
  - When incorrect number is eaten, the snake dies (or loses a life)
- If the snake hits itself, the game ends
- If the snake eats the correct 0/1 combo and completes the translation, a new (harder) number is presented and the game continues
  - Maybe: the snake speeds up too...  
- Maybe:  User can play in easier/harder modes.  Easy mode gives user the number of digits needed for the translation
- Maybe: sound effects when correct/incorrect pellets eaten and full number translated, etc.
- Maybe: the snake's segments take on the number of the corresponding food eaten


### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

e.g.

- Snake moves around screen
- Snake can eat 0s or 1s
- When a number is eaten, the snake grows in length
- If the snake hits itself or eats wrong number, the game ends
- Game ends when a number is successfully translated

### What have you accomplished so far?

- A multi-segment snake moves around the canvas in response to user input

# Instructor Feedback Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)

* 50: First check in form and README was completed and pull requested in. Team has a well documented plan for moving forward with their game. Team has completed some wireframing and/or written code.
* 40: First check in form and README was completed and pull requested in. Team has a well documented plan for moving forward with their game. Team has not written any code or created any wireframe documents.
* 25: First check in form completed but shows little effort at documenting/planning and team has not written any code.
* 0: First check in form was not completed.

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

* Goal 1: _eg. Create snake head constructor that draws itself on the canvas_

* Goal 2: _eg. Stop snake from moving past the boundry of the canvas when moving - write tests_

* Goal 3: _eg. Configure jshint and .jshintrc_

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_

### Stretch Goals

* _ie. Goals that are not required to meet the checkin, but would be good to have. Completion may result in extra credit points_
