### Work Completed

This is the repo where I have been saving some of the exercises I have been working through in the Head First Java book:
[Head First Java Exercises](https://github.com/dtinianow/head_first_java)

So far, I have worked through the first four chapters of the book:

- The first chapter of the book describes how Java is taken from source, run through a compiler, produces an output, and is read by a Java virtual machine.  From there it goes on to provide a broad overview of Java as a whole, and also goes into further depth about how the Java language works in relation to the compiler and JVM.

- The second chapter describes the principles of OOP and how they apply specifically to Java.  As a Ruby developer, this was useful to read to learn about some of the principles that truly overarch OOP as a whole, such as inheritance, instance variables, and methods.  One unique feature of Java is that you need to have a main method that will run the rest of your code.

- The third chapter talks about another key feature of Java, which is that it has primitives and references.  Java is unique from Ruby in that it is a statically-typed language.  Also when you save an object as a variable, you are not actually saving that object as variable, but rather saving a reference to that object on the heap.

- The fourth chapter discusses how state and behavior interact within an object.  This interaction is quite similar to Ruby and the OOP we are familiar with.  One important difference is that type is extremely important when passing a parameter to method.  The type must match the argument defined in the function, or be smaller than it (ie a byte can be used in place on an int, but an int cannot be used in place of a byte).

I completed the introductory 'Hello World' exercism in Java, which you can find in my PR link above.

I also spent some time working on the Linked List exercise we were given in class two Fridays ago.  This is in anticipation of building the Jungle Beat project in Java.

The plan for this project is to learn Java and the Linked List data structure.  My plan is to keep plowing ahead in the Head First Java book for the next few days to keep honing in on the basics of Java.  I will aim to start the Jungle Beat project this weekend or by Monday at the latest.
