  * Creact Tutorial

- Thursday (~8 hours):
  * Morning class
  * Continue Creact
    * Take notes while doing it, blog post on learning through resources.
  * This is written before Thursday is done, I plan on selecting an issue to work though
  * Since Kris is back, I'd also like to be able to have a project discussion as a group.

- Weekend (~6-10 hours):
  * This is written before Thursday is done, I plan on working on the selected issue, and finishing up my blog post as well as reviewing others.

### Participation

We haven't really done many PRs, I did make a comment on [Kris' PR](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/pull/82#issuecomment-256675543) when he fixed the tests. I wanted to know why the information has changed, because we shouldn't make changes to the tests if we don't understand why that is the output, and I'd like there to be a conversation so everyone is on the same page.

### Work Completed

Link to and describe the code/research you have completed so far.

A mess documenting the things I've looked into.
