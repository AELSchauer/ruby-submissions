### Participation

Speak to your participation in PRs (links would be nice), blog reviews and in your project groups.

- I reviewed one blog outline and provided on minor comment
- I tried to review one PR but two people had already reviewed it and there wasn't really anything else to comment on.
- I missed standup yesterday to work on code challenge for a job prospect.  

### Work Completed

- I completed testing for all API endpoints for an internal API built in Node.
- I figured out how to deploy a node app on Heroku and to import an existing database to a production Heroku database.  I have a blog post draft on this process.
- I have API documentation partially built using Swagger
- I completed about 15 hours of a Udacity course on data visualization in D3.  I don't think I "counted" all of these hours.
- I did about 4 hours of research on DimpleJS (a data vis library built on top of D3) in the form of making charts in D3 for my code challenge.  Given that I lost 2 days of worktime on the code challenge, I will probably use DimpleJS for this project rather than D3.  I will work on D3 post Turing.
- I researched Swagger for documentation.
