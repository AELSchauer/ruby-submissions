### Work Completed

https://github.com/roscalabrin/climbing-sensei/blob/master/src/components/UI/Routine.js.jsx

This is a modal pop-up that launches when a user clicks an individual workout. I enjoy using React because
it's fun to use logic to solve UI problems. Here I am setting a local state for this component so that the
user can switch through the tabs in the modal.
