- Feedback provided to Matt Packer re: blog outline:
  ```
  Introduction
  ------
  - You're covering a lot in the introduction - if this is meant to be just one introductory paragraph it may be cluttered with content. I would consider having your first bullet point ('who is this blog written for') as an italicized preface before your opening paragraph.

  Gameplan
  ------
  - I really like the idea of linking to the docs and resources you've used - it will allow others to recreate your process.
  - Again, you have a lot of content here. I think some could end up just as bullet points, to help improve the flow and readability. Specifically, consuming an API and parsing the JSON data could be talked about in conjunction with one another, and re-evaluate features seems like the end of what could ultimately be a loop cycle?

  What Actually Happened
  ------
  - If you don't find space to showcase some code snippets in the previous section, I think it would be highly beneficial to share some here. Particularly when it comes to resolving the challenges you faced and the exciting moments. I think these code snippets would be more powerful than small snippets of something you learned.
  - I think these bullets will end up providing more content than you may be anticipating currently. I think having an explicit conclusion section that includes your learning outcome may help to keep everything sectioned off.

  Resources
  ------
  - No suggestions here. I really like the idea of providing links to your own projects as well as resources.
  ```
- Feedback provided to Chris Concannon re: draft blog post:
  ```
  Great blog post. You went into a somewhat granular level of detail without losing the reader, and your links provide excellent resources and guide anyone trying to follow along.

  I think you could make the post even more useful for someone attempting to follow along by including some screenshots of a few of the steps. This could be as simple as a code snippet for checking out the branch in step 2, screenshots for examples of the menus you're referencing in options A, B, and 5, and, probably most powerful would be a 'victory shot' of the 'Hello, World' text displayed.

  Anyway, these would just be aesthetic modifications - the content is great. Nice work.
  ```

### Work Completed

- [Initial Code from React App](https://github.com/ryanflach/good-morning-sunshine)
- [Firebase working with React in Production](https://good-morning-sunshine.herokuapp.com/)
- I've pivoted this project twice, so I have little to show for my efforts this far. I have, however, completed a lot of research and am excited about the direction I am taking with Elixir.
