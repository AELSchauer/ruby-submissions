### Hours

Document your general hours below (or planned hours)

- Pre-Work (1 to 3 hours): 5 hours total
- Monday (8 hours): 2.5 hours (job activities)
- Tuesday (8 hours): 2.5 hours (job activities)
- Wednesday (8 hours): 9.0 hours
- Thursday (8 hours): 9.0 hours
- Weekend (0 hours): 8.0 hours

note: most of Monday and Tuesday were spent in job-related activities. I thoughtfully applied to over 25 positions across more than 10 companies this week, and participated in voluntary meetings with Turing alums and Ian Douglas. My resume and cover letter skeletons are in a finalized form and I will have more time to focus on Scale Up through the end of the project.

### Participation

I gave feedback to David and Ryan for their blog posts (both drafts at the time) and both appreciated the feedback. I submitted my post for others to review and I received feedback from Matt P, Ryan, and Zack. I incorporated most of the feedback that they all gave, which included suggestions for code snippets, screenshots, and links inside my post.

### Work Completed

I have worked through Lesson 2, and into Lesson 3, of the "Sunshine App" tutorial created by Google and posted on Udacity. Things that I have covered which will be relevant for my app:
- rendering buttons and layouts
- creating "Adapters" which present raw data to the view
- rendering views
- finding views in order to manipulate the screen (similar to DOM traversing)
- creating Services for interaction with external API's
- using the Android Logs (adb logcat) for development and debugging
- creating "Toast" notifications upon actions such as a list item click
- using AsyncTask for background tasks within an applied
- granting permissions (such as Internet Access) to apps
- JSON parsing

As detailed in my blog post, I ran into several tough issues when trying to get my environment running and while learning to deploy my development code to my phone for debugging and feature exploration. I will continue to expand upon my experiences through more posts - at least 1 more, and likely 2 more before project completion.
