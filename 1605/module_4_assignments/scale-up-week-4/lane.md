* Blog review 1 for Matt P.
    * I have a few thoughts. First, I liked the outline and thought it was laid out well. I really liked how you included a part on things that you want to cover in the future assuming that scale up will not satisfy what you set out to accomplish. I also agree with you stating that you will include code snippets that your excited about. I think that is always helpful when reading something a bit more technical.
Are you planning on using medium?
Did you just create this outline or model it from somewhere?


* Blog review 2 for Jason

    * Thats a great outline and I like how its more oh a how to vs this is what I experienced. One thing I would think about adding in light of the Turing community is having your code reviewed or ask questions to people with more practice but thats just a thought.

### Work Completed

Link to and describe the code/research you have completed so far.

* I would also like to clean up and add functionality for the trending languages data map. I currently do not have a [WIP] PR for this because I am having odd issues with merge conflicts.
