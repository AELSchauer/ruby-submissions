### Participation

PR Participation:

 - We inherited a PR from the previous cohort. I reviewed the PR and found there were merge conflicts. I added a comment and tagged the previous developers. They responded and I set up a meeting to go over the PR, find out what they were working on and hopefully resolve the conflicts and merge the request. [#77](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/pull/77)

 - We inherited 2 failing tests. I analyzed the code base and fixed the errors in the test. I issued a detailed PR for the updates. I added details to the PR based on questions from developers who reviewed the code. [#82](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/pull/82)

 - I have participated in all 4 stand-ups this week. I was absent for 1 but sent my updates and got updates on the stand-up from developers who where present.

 - I have actively communicated with my team via Slack, Basecamp, and GitHub. I have issued PR's, made suggestions, responded to comments and been proactive regarding our project.

### Work Completed  

Most of the work I have completed to date is in the form of classes and tutorials. I should have more to show in terms of code and PR's over the next couple of days.
