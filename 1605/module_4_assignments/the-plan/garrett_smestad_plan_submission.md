### Which Assignments and Why?

- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?
 - [Goals Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/module_4_assignments/the-plan/assignments/goals.markdown)
 - [Side Hustle Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/module_4_assignments/the-plan/assignments/side-hustle.markdown)
 - [Community Involvement Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/module_4_assignments/the-plan/assignments/community-involvement.markdown)
 
- Why did you choose these assignments?
 - I chose to complete the Goals assignment because it was required, and it can be beneficial to set goals in writing to help you stay on track.
 - I chose to complete the Side Hustle assignment because I thoroughly enjoyed working on my self-directed project from Mod 3, and felt the most compelled to keep going with that project more than any other I've worked on. I had sent the link out to several people, simply because I was proud of it, and was surprised by the reaction I got from many of them. One person has asked me _twice_ now if they can invest, to which I responded that it "currently isn't exactly a money-making venture," and a number of others have said that they would use it (a few already have). The feedback has only made me want to keep working on it even more.
 - I chose to complete the Community Involvement assignment because now that Turing is over, I finally will have the time to actually attend the meet-ups and conferences that are so critical to the networking process.
