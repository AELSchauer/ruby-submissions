### Which Assignments and Why?
- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?

My own combination of goals, job stalking and side hustle - in a way that's more actionable for me. 
Also very detailed on short term activities and more general plans for longer term activities.  I've learned enough to know that plans change and it's important for me to not commit to specific long term plans in a way that makes me too rigid.

- Why did you choose these assignments?

I need a job stalking one because I'm not super excited about job prospects so I need to commit to this in writing. 
I also choose to focus on goals before side hustle because I feel like side hustle can sometimes lead me to get things done vs learn things.
