Notes:
* 30 tests, all passing
* Did in place insertion sort and selection sort.
* Clean code, look to use methods to pull out complex conditionals.


### Functional Expectations

* 4: All three sort classes work as expected with 2 or more extensions.

### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### Ruby Style

* 4: Any given chunk of code can be understood at a single level of abstraction

### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase
