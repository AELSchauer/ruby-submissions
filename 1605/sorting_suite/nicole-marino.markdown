Notes:
* Had to fix path to get tests to run.
* 9 tests, all passing
* did in place insertion in lieu of insertion

### Functional Expectations

* 3: All three sort classes work as expected

### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### Ruby Style

* 3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

### Organization

* 3: Each sorter class has it's own file in the proper directory and it's own test in the test directory
