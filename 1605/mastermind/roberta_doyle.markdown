Notes:

* two large classes
* Program fully functional, although there was some confusion as to how
the cheat functionality worked.
* There are the beginnings of organization, remember to pull out code that
belongs together to their own separate classes.
* Saw that classes took arguments and return values a lot - great keep it up
* Think about how you would pull out any text printed out to the screen into
its own class or a module for organizational purposes.
