__Comments:__

* 24 tests, well tested, could use some edge cases, sad path tests.
* Some commented out tests and comments in code.
* some methods were pretty long and could use some refactoring,
breaking code out into separate methods.
* BST was done iteratively.

__Comments:__

* 68 tests, 34 node tests, 57 tree tests, etc
* I like how all methods are listed at top with respond_to tests
* can build a tree by accepting an array
* number of leaves doesnt work
* good use of recursion
* generally clean code
* some opportunities to refactor, but generally minor
* there is a structure of a BST, tree, and node, and some duplication among
them
* did File I/O

__Comments:__

* 127 tests, all pass.
* All extensions
* Code checks for data type and will only allow trees of matching
types to be created.
* Good use of recursion
* Well tested, good, thorough tests, would like to have seen more
sad path testing.
* excellent use of exceptions
