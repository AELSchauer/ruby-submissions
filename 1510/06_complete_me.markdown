__Comments:__

* Good feature completion with 1 extension (handling large address file)
added
* Interesting ideas around module extraction for insertion logic
* Good balance between node objects and top-level completion object;
completion mostly handing off responsibilities to sub nodes
* Code is overall quite clean -- short methods, good enumerable stuff
making things concise
* Would be interesting to refactor structure so that Substring and CompleteMe
don't both have to have hash of links
* Lots of tests, covering good cases
* 1 small edge case around counting subsequent selections

__Comments:__

* Strong functionality; base works with 1 extension
* Some words seem to be disappearing on insert (or not getting counted); would
be curious to figure out where these are going
* Word selection works and handles subsequent selections within the same
substring
* Good ideas around separating objects between trie/node/top-level completion;
possibly the interface between trie and complete me could be smoothed a bit to
remove some of the extra cases in the top-level

__Comments:__

* Partial feature completion
* Testing is reasonable and fairly plentiful
* Overall difficulties seem to stem from getting multiple cases
or pathways tangled together

__Comments:__

* Basic functionality is all there
* Some concerns around internalizing concepts vs. achieving functional objectives
* Test numbers seem ok
* Solution is overall quite clean; possibly too clean; might have developed
greater understanding through trying more sloppy solutions
* Node class is getting a little big; maybe there is opportunity to
trim it by either extracting another class or reducing unnecessary cases

__Comments:__

* Nice work with the shoes; other base functionality also working good
* Added the inclusive fuzzy search as well
* Fancy error handling on various inputs
* Overall method tidyness and conciseness is strong
* General enumerable usage is solid; handful of cases where multiple
different enumerables might be able to be consolidated
