### Aaron Greenspan
Assessor: Tess

Notes:

* All passing spec harness tests
* 100% test coverage
* API design was innovative, but because of that some of the BI methods weren't clear
* In some places it wasn't clear what the method was actually returing
* Great experimentation, but sometimes you have to balance clarity

### Beth Sebian

Assessor: Tess

Notes:

* Failed 10 tests on the spec harness
* Only BI was revenue
* Implemented a serializer for a few models. Used one for the revenue.
* Unfortunate not to get a lot of the BI done, but what was there was clean which is a good sign
