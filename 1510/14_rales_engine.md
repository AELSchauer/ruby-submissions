### Aaron Greenspan
Assessor: Tess

Notes:

* All passing spec harness tests
* 100% test coverage
* API design was innovative, but because of that some of the BI methods weren't clear
* In some places it wasn't clear what the method was actually returing
* Great experimentation, but sometimes you have to balance clarity
