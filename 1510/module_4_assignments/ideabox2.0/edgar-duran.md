# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Proud of](https://github.com/edgarduran/ideabox-2.0/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideaEdit.js#L37-L40)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I figured out an efficient way to hide the current idea while showing the editing form over it.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Not proud](https://github.com/edgarduran/ideabox-2.0/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js#L6-L48)
* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
I feel like these two methods do the same thing with the exception of where they interpolate the html. I bet I could have refactored into one method with a conditional at least. Plus interploating a huge dive in the method also is excesive. I should have pulled that variable out. The biggest challenge was time.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
