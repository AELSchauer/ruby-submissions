## Completion

### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
Nope.  
* Filter and Search is missing
* testing completely absent

### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
None  

### Attach a .gif, or images of any extensions work being used on the site.

# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Model methods](https://github.com/bethsebian/revenge_of_idea_box/blob/master/app/models/idea.rb)
I was pleased to have a chance to move some of these methods to the model.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[ideas.js file](https://github.com/bethsebian/revenge_of_idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js)
* This seems like a mess.
* Different approaches to do the same thing (add new element waits for trigger in a different way than other functions)

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
n/a. face-palm.  

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
Some weird page reloads going on. My Ajax updates content without the page reload, but a reload is triggered somehow after that (see add new and update).
