### Summarize what you worked on
As a user viewing a company show page, we should be able to see the company
name, basic company information and a list of all jobs related to that company.

- Company name and number of jobs listed headline the page
- All jobs related to company listed below
- Jobs ordered with most recent at the top
- Paginated so that no more than 10 jobs show per page
- Company has a list of technologies that have been tagged across all job
postings below the job listings
- Link to company show was added to the index page for jobs

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
It's a good practice I wish we had more time for during projects at Turing.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I was part of daily stand ups in my old job and I really enjoy them. Even in
sales, it was helpful for me to hear daily updates on the direction of the
product I was selling and provide customer feedback to the dev team. At Turing,
it was helpful to practice get a feel for the daily routine once we've
graduated and aren't living like peasants anymore.

### What features would you like to see LookingFor have in the future?
- A search feature where you can browse jobs by location or technology would be
really useful.
- Links in the job show page to the live job application page
