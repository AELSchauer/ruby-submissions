###User Story
- User will press start game
- instructions appear
- user receives 5 "arrows"
- When user presses spacebar, arrows is shot down vertically until it either hits a fish or the bottom of the sea
- Each time a fish is hit, it's (y-coordinate) score is added to the overall score
- Once a user has used all 5 "arrows" game is over and total score is put above leaderboard and on leaderboard if appropriate
- User is able to restart the game

### Difficulty settings
  - fish at surface swim relatively faster act as obstacles for bigger fish at bottom
  - as time increases fish swim faster making it harder to reach bottom fish

### MVP
1. Create Canvas (blue rectangle 80% of height)
2. Fish hit boundary and reverse direction along same x axis
3. Create boat stationary in center
5. Boat shoots bullets vertically at fixed velocity when spacebar is pressed
6. Bullet collision with fish results in bullet
7. fish disappearing fishes y coordinate added to score
8. Shots remaining counter decreases by 1
9. When shots remaining counter == 0, Game Over
10. Leaderboard appears with newest score on top
11. Leaderboard has link to restart
12. Fish move faster as time increases


### Extensions
- Fish move up and down along y-axis
- user adds initials to score on leaderboard

### Crazy Extensions
- p5.js amplitude dependent fish speeds, beginner level is slow song with smooth moving fish, expert is fast song with jerky fish
