## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

e.g.

- Player moves around the screen in 1st person 3D.
- Obstacles are randomly generated on game load which prevent the player's movement.
- Enemy tanks are randomly generated which can move around and fire at the player.
- Player can fire weapon and destroy enemy tanks.
- Player has access to radar, range information, score and high score.
- On screen targeter indicating when enemy targeted.
- Background rendered
- New game screen, end game screen, score tracking in cookie.  

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

As above but without...

- Obstacles
- Radar + range + targeting information.
- Background.
- tank-like rendering of enemies.

### What have you accomplished so far?

Solid DTR and how this is going to be implemented, especially concerning rendering.
