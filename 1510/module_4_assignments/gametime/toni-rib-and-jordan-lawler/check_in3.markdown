A lot of things were added to meet this goal:

  - Written instructions on the left side
  - Written descriptions of the towers on the right side
  - Build tile highlighting when you click on a tile & change of tower prompt
  - Tower buttons grey out if you can't afford them
  - Animations when a tower is shooting at an enemy
