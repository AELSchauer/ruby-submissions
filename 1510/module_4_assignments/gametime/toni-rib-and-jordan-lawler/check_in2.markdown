  - Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
    - Nope! We implemented "Level 1" as just the basic game pretty much exactly how we said we were going to do it.
  - Questions, Comments, Concerns?
    - What more could you want than poptart cats and whales shooting pizza and bananas?

## Next Steps?

In no particular order:

  - Get all of the appropriate content on the menu
  - Implement turning, the enemies can follow a path with turns
  - Set up the menus for game wins/game losses
  - Implement paper monies concept
  - Implement the concept of levels
  - More enemies! More towers! More levels! More awesomeness!
  - Refactor

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?

Turning seems a little complicated but we're pretty sure we've worked out the logic for how we want to do it. However, there might be unforseen complications due to the enemies varying speed.
