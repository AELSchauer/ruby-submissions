# Game Time Check In # 2

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOAL 1: Shooting

- [Gif](http://g.recordit.co/8tkzFcb4zD.gif)
- Nope
- Nope

### GOAL 2: Collision Detection

- [Same Gif](http://g.recordit.co/8tkzFcb4zD.gif)
- Nope
- The tank gets "collided" with based on the border of the image, which means some bullets hit
whitespace and it destroys the tank. We're working on how to fix this. We'll probably make the "size" of the tank smaller than the image.

### GOAL 3: Add sprites

- [Same Gif](http://g.recordit.co/8tkzFcb4zD.gif)
- Nope
- The aliens arms move too fast. We think we have an idea on how to fix this.

### GOAL 4: Start/End game

- [Same Gif](http://g.recordit.co/8tkzFcb4zD.gif)
- Nope
- We need to beef these up, but its just a matter of making images that we can draw onscreen. We investigated
bringing in a google font to render on the canvas, but the amount of time/effort required to make that happen
doesn't seem like the best use of our time.
