## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Start screen invites player to start game.
- User clicks on squares to rotate the image in each square.
- When no unconnected endpoints remain, user has solved problem and the screen pulses with light briefly.
- As the player advances through different patterns, the size of the pattern canvas grows, up to grids of 10 x 10.
- After completing a level, screen announces how many challenges the player has completed.
- Game contains 15 patterns minimum.
- Each square unit is one of five arrangements: partial circle, circle with spoke, straight line, double curve, quadruple curve.
- Game remembers user and starts them at the level they last completed.
