## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Level based game with at least one level (path and build sites change per level)
- Multiple waves of enemies, different enemies or number of enemies per wave
- Different kinds of enemies have different speeds and health (5 total)
- Different kinds of towers have different ranges, fire rates, and damage (4 total)
- User places towers on specific building squares based on their paper monies (purchase towers)
- Towers fire at a specific rate at enemies within their range (100% hit rate)
- Accrue more paper monies as enemies are destroyed
- For each level, specific number of 'lives' which is how many enemies can reach the end of the path before you lose
- Different difficulty levels will allow different number of 'lives'

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- One level, all enemies in one wave (but spread out so they come through at different times)
- Straight horizontal path
- One type of enemy
- One type of tower
- Very few build paths
- No paper monies :(
