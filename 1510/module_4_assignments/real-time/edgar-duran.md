  - Yesh

### List any functionality from the case studies that is missing

### Did you do anything outside the scope of the case studies?
  - Don't think so.

# Code Quality

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
  - I was able to post to an admin poll or and open poll in the same post method based on the referrer.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

## Instructor Feedback

116/200

### Concept and Features

Does it have the expected features?

* 50 points - Some features were sacrificed to meet the deadline. At best, this is a prototype. Major features covered by the learning goals listed above were not written by the developer.

### Code Quality (JavaScript and/or Ruby)

* 20 points - Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components. Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many large methods or functions and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code does.

### Client-Side Application

* 20 points - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or major bugs.

### Test-Driven Development

* 20 points - The code demonstrates high test coverage. One or more enpoints are not tested or the internal business logic is not fully tested.

### Interface

* 2 points - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.

### Workflow

* 4 points - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
