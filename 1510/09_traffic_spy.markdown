Notes:

* 64 tests, 106 assertions, all passing.
* No extensions
* cool text entry identifier on front page
* 96.93% test coverage
* generally good testing, didn't test error page
* Some opportunities to refactor, pull things out to other methods.
* Little bit of logic leaking to the view.


Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:
1. Functional Expectations

    3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. Test-Driven Development

    4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

    4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

    4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

6. View Layer

    3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

    2: Application has some small missing base functionality
    1: Application is not usable

2. Test-Driven Development

    4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
    3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests
    2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
    1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

    4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
    3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
    2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
    1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
    3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
    2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
    1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

    4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.
    3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.
    2: Application has web and business logic totally mixed together
    1: Application demonstrates a weak understanding of Sinatra and how applications should be built.

6. View Layer

    4: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers.
    3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view
    2: Application has messy views that mix logic and presentation
    1: Application shows a lack of understanding around view templates and how they should be used/constructed.

Notes:

* 79 tests, 190 assertions, all passing
* Good use of helper methods in tests.
* 99.54% Coverage
* Used Materialize
* Try to lighten up on use of instance variables in controller.
* Some minor refactoring possible with pulling things out of controller
or refactoring to pull out code to methods.

Notes:

* 104 assertions 47 test,
* 96.5 coverage
* Used a few partials.
* Some opportunities to refactor ruby into separate methods.
* I liked how you used methods to abstract out conditionals.
* Think aobut how you would refactor to make use of Poros and helper
methods in your view.
