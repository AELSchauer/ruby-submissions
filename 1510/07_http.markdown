Scores:

1. Overall Functionality

4: Application implements all five iterations and at least one extension
3: Application implements four iterations
2: Application implements three iteration
1: Application implements two or fewer iterations

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

3. Test-Driven Development

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.
2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.
1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

4. Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

Notes:

* 44 tests, all passing
* Some weird errors on my computer, but not on Rachels, suspect my computer is wonky.
* Fulfills all requirements up to I4.
* Well structured code, some minor areas where things could be pulled out into smaller methods

Notes:

* 62 tests, all pass.
* One extension
* All functionality works.
* Well organized, code, things were broken out into separate methods in a good fashion.
* Think about class methods, and modules.

Assessed By: Mike

Github: http://github.com/gregoryarmstrong/http

Notes:

* 44 tests
* i 1-3 complete, 4 does not completely work
* Some longer methods with opportunities to refactor for clarity and simplicity,
specifically in methods with long complex conditionals, and try to avoid writing methods
that modify an instance variable, as opposed to accepting a parameter and returing a value


Scores:

1. Overall Functionality

2: Application implements three iteration

Notes:

* 25 tests,
* tests should be structured so that they dont require interactivity
with postman/whatever
* some opportunities to refactor down longer methods, and clear up some
unnecessary variable assignment
