### Barker - Tinder for dogs

If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here


### Pitch

Live in a city and have a dog? Feel bad it's cooped up in your apartment all day? Barker is an app to find some doggy dates!

### Problem

Dogs don't just get along with any other dog. We are busy, we don't have time to travel across the city. We have different schedules. Dog parks are gross. We need something to find dogs close by that are available now to play. Also need some background on the dogs (feedback from other dog dates) to make sure it'll be a good fit for your dog.

### Solution

This app will preview any message that you are planning to send and will determine if it's CnB status. If you try texting too soon or use trigger words like "Love" it will not allow the message to go through. Other options available like have a friend reivew/approve your message and suggestion replacements for messages.

### Target Audience

Anyone that has a dog that lives close to other people that have a dog.

### Integrations

* What OAuth provider makes sense for this audience? facebook
* What API will you use?  something like tinder
* Any other integrations?
