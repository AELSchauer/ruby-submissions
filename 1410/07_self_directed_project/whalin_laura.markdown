### Food Baby

If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here

### Pitch

An app that quickly identifies family-friendly restaurants, whether you want to take your kids there, or avoid them entirely.

### Problem

Your child is a bit fussy and you’re hungry. How can you find a restaurant where people won’t give you the stink-eye if a minor temper-tantrum erupts?

or, the reverse

You and your spouse finally get a night out! You want to find a restaurant without high chairs, flinging food, that has a completely adult atmosphere.

### Solution

An app for parents to quickly identify kid-friendly restaurants. Or, the opposite: an app for adults to quickly identify restaurants where children are banned.

### Target Audience

This app is targeted at hungry adults, either with or without children.

### Elvis Lives

If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here

### Pitch

An app for viewing where Elvis has been sighted over time, to help determine if he is still living.

### Problem

So much mystery and doubt surrounds the death of Elvis. Could he still be alive? If only there were a way to find the highest concentration of Elvis sightings.

### Solution

This app tracks Elvis sightings throughout the US by year based on tags from Flickr and places them on a google heat map. Over time, we can see if Elvis sightings have dropped, or increased.

### Target Audience

Anyone who is curious to find out if the King is still in the house.

### Integrations

### Honestly Hungry

If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here

### Pitch

An app that aggregates twitter comments about local restaurants, giving users a more honest, unbiased picture of a restaurant's service than might be written in other review sites.

### Problem

Reviews about restaurants are written with a lot of bias, either hightlighting an extremely good experience, or an extremely bad one. Wouldn't it be nice to get a more honest look at restaurants from users?

### Solution

Extract more honest feedback from twitter mentions of local restaurants, which may be assumed to be more honest than a full-blown review.

### Target Audience

Hungry people looking for a good dining experience.

### Integrations

* What API will you use?
