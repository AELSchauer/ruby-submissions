### Pitch

Sound bank for Native Americans.
La galeria de Nahuatl, idioma de los mexicanos.

### Problem

Nahuatl was spoken widely throughout Central Mexico until the mid-20th century.
A dialect of Nahuatl spoken by an isolated group of Nahuas in Oaxaca is on the path to
extinction; the only native speakers are over 70 years old. Currently, younger
people learn several dozen words, but there is no way to share their knowledge
with others or listen to the words except when they are in the company of their
elderly relatives.

### Solution

This app will allow younger generations to record words and phrases to create an
online sound dictionary. Furthermore, it family members who cannot travel to
their hometown to still listen and practice the words and phrases.

### Target Audience

The target audience is children and grandchildren of Nahuatl speakers from
Putla and Juxtlahuaxa, Oaxaca, Mexico.
