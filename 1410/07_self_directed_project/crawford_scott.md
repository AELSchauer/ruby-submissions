#Monthly Music Mood
This allows a user to look back at the music that defined their life for a period of time.

Often times I find myself going through different 'music seasons'. I will listen to a group of songs a lot for a little while and then forget about them. This allows me to remember what those songs were that had my attention for that short period of time and take me back to that part time of my life.

I will pull in a users data from spotify and generate playlists based on the top played songs for that particular month. Then I will take those top songs from the month and analyze the lyrics and genre to determine the mood of the playlist.

The target audience would be people who listen to music most likely in the age range of 16 - 30.

I would tap into spotify, and then maybe facebook to share the playlists. I would use spotify's api.
Other integrations would be adding another user to the playlist to tie the playlist to other users, if they were an important part of your life during that time.

#Date Night
This allows the user to generate a date itinerary for an evening based on location and price.

The problem is that people suck at coming up with creative dates. They might have the ability to find one restaurant but they don't have the skill to create an evening of spontaneity and fun.

This will generate a date night based on a users location and price range and time. It will give directions to each spot, and a brief description of the place. Date night will bring that spark back to anyone's relationship.

The target audience would probably be younger, single, and dating.

I would use yelp, open table, and google maps api. I would OAuth Twitter/Facebook so that they can tweet about their date. Other integrations would be to create your own dates and then search custom date nights.

#Coffee
You can search for craft coffee shops, save your favorite, and store your personal coffee recipes.

The problem is that too many cafes serve garbage coffee. It is hard to know where you'll be able to find a quality cup wherever you are.

This app will create a list of top coffee shops which a user can search for. Then it will also allow the user to see how they make their coffee and then save their own personal recipes.

The target audience is coffee drinkers.

I would use yelp to get reviews, google maps to locate the places, and twitter to tweet about the shops and the recipes. Other features would be to text 'recipe aeropress' to the app and get back a random recipe.
