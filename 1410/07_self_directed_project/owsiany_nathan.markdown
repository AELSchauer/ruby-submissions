individual contributors, commits, langauges, and more.

### Target Audience

Developers working on projects hosted on Github with more than one contributor

time, where they are, and where they are going and recieve a text telling them
when to go outside to catch the bus

be populated with other user's lists (friends favorites, etc.), as well as curated
lists (oscar nominees, best picture winners, etc.). With movie rating data and
