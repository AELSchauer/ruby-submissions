Notes:

* Looking at CompleteMe
* Spec harness passes
* Project tests have a good progression of thinking
* Would like to see more edge cases and unhappy-path tests
* Implementation code looks good with some tiny areas for improvement
* Research what a recursive implementation would look like
* Did the addresses extension, added SimpleCov

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
