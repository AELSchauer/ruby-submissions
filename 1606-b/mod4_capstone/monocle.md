### 3. Implementation Quality

* Create method in companies controller needs some refactoring.
* Update in locations could use some refactoring. State could be brought into strong_params.

* Notes controller needs some work. #create and #update.
* Declaring flashes in different ways. I would decide as a team the preferred style and go with that for consistency.
