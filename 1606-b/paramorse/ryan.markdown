Notes:

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality
* 2: Application converts to and back successfully

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 3. Test-Driven Development
2.5 
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.
* 2: Minor mutations to the implementation code, such as swaping characters, changing `<` to `<=`, placing `true` into a conditional, or deleting a line of code which break the functionality do not cause any tests to fail.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
