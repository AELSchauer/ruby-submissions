Notes:

* Looking at Flashcards
* 17 tests all pass
* Tests look pretty good but need to think about edge cases and non-happy-path tests
* Implementation is overall good. Some spots have more code than you need.


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
