Repo: https://github.com/gprocell927/Module-1

Notes:
- No extensions, 1-6 complete
- Naming of tests and methods
- Make sure there are no skipped tests, or unused files. Create lib and test folders
- Effort to use TDD, could have slightly more robust testing
- Opportunities for refactoring, but style good in general

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
