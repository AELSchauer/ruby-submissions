Notes:

* 42 tests, 4 pending
* Some clusters of tests but not a lot of cohesion / difficult to follow the story
* What does it do? "Not much." It takes your name and generates a board object.
* Overall struggled with approach/organization
* Tried to make it "just work" without really focusing on scale/quality, but
that didn't work
* Work on some exercisms the next few days to practice building small things
