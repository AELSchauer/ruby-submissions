Notes:
* 100 tests, 18 failing.

* some methods doing way too much, very complex conditionals

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

### 3. Test-Driven Development


* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient


### 4. REPL Interface
