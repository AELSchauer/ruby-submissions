Notes:
- Runner accepted q and i input, did not run when p inserted
- Nice implementation and structure around grid
- Would like to see grid simplified from string to array, some more intuitive ordering of positions in the grid
- Nice testing around grid, demonstrates TDD
- Idea of module for messages nice

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:
### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections
* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 4. REPL Interface
* 1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together
