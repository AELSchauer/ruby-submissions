## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully


### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components


* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
