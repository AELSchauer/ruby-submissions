Notes:
* Can tell that you worked really hard to try to get through everything
* High charts was a struggle, so trying to take that into account
* Definitely some gaps in code quality and understanding where components belong
* Was not up on production so low score for UX, but it did look good on local host,
agreed to move up to a 3 if on production by end of day.
* Didn't score performance because page wasn't loading in browser but the charts were.
Not sure what was going on there.
