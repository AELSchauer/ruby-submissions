Notes:

* Tracker indicates all expected features are delivered
* user experience is pretty solid
* Day navigation and persistence works
* Log stays accurate with changes, edits, deletions
* Testing looks really good
* Look out for little things like target/verify based on CSS classes rather than specific values
* Experiment with dynamic ID generation in your view rendering to allow for targeting on identity rather than hierarchy (nth-child)
* JavaScript implementation style is beautiful
* Good job isolating the ugly/unpleasant parts and keeping them away from the good stuff

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

### Testing

- 4: All functionality is covered by tests. Tests can be run both in the browser and terminal. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests

### HTML/CSS/UI

- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.

### JS syntax and Style

- 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate

### Git Workflow

- 4: Team uses Uses master for production, develop as the current state of development and feature branches for individual work. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation

### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories
