Notes:

* Tracker is in good shape
* It actually looks pretty good!
* Functionality appears to work well
* Tests look well structured with some opportunities to isolate repeated functionality / "magic data"
* JavaScript implementation is pretty clean and easy to read/understand

## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application has all functionality

### Testing

- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

### HTML/CSS/UI

- 4: Team used CSS preprocessor and put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes for DOM traversal, and data namespace attributes

### JS syntax and Style

- 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate

### Git Workflow

- 3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories
