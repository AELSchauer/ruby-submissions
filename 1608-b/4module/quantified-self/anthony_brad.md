## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application has all functionality built, with no bugs, and one extension
- **3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**
- 2: Application is missing required functionality, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable
- 1: Application is missing a significant portion of functionality

### Testing

- 4: All functionality is covered by tests. Tests can be run both in the browser and terminal. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests
- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.
- **2: More functionality implemented than tested or only uses one test type**

- 1: Team fails to effectively test the application.

### HTML/CSS/UI

- 4: Team used CSS preprocessor and put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes for DOM traversal, and data namespace attributes
- **3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.**
- 2: HTML is greatly lacking in standards compliance. UI is confusing or very buggy.
- 1: Application is unusable

### JS syntax and Style

- 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate
- **3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**
- 2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.
- 1: Team has not applied any style concepts from class or from Ruby background

### Git Workflow

- 4: Team uses Uses master for production, develop as the current state of development and feature branches for individual work. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation
- **3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature**
- 2: Team fails to use feature branches, or isn't using pull requests
- 1: All code is committed to master

### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories
- **3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized. Nearly every card has been turned into user stories.**
- 2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently. Many cards have no changes made to them
- 1: Team failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.
