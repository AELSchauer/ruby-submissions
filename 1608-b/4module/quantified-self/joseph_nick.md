Notes:

* 42 tests, mostly feature.
* Fully functional app, no bugs.
* I like how meals are combined.


## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

### Testing

- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

### HTML/CSS/UI

- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.

### JS syntax and Style

- 3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.

### Git Workflow

- 3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories
