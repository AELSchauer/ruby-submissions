Notes:
* test harness - iteration 5, no failures, no errors
* test suite - 82 tests, 116 assertions, 0 errors, 0 failures - 100% coverage
* good unit testing and separation of responsbilities
* good use of modules and creation of helper methods along the way
* some long methods could be refactored
* "joey is a reduce ninja" -jon kimble

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 *as well as* one of Iterations 5 or 6

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods


### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...
