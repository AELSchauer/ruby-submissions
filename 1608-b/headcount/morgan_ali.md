Notes:
* 139 tests
* 100 percent coverage
* spec harness passes
* Iteration 5
* No extensions
* There were sad path tests
* Look into how you can use enumerables to make tests more robust.
* Overall code was well written and organized well with some small areas
where there could be some refactoring for clarity.
* Some of the math could be pulled out into modules to bring class size down.



### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 *as well as* one of Iterations 5 or 6

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints
