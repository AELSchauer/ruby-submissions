Notes: 
* Got through 4 and added 6
* Testing overall strong, would like to see more unit testing with stubbing or mocking
* SRP generally upheld; only shortcoming is methods juggling a lot of responsibility 
* Style overall strong, some weird things with returning true/false when simple condition would suffice
* Some great use of enumerables (group_by) but opportunities to replace each in certain scenarios with better choices
* O sanitation errors


### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 *as well as* one of Iterations 5 or 6

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation
* 4: Zero complaints
