Notes:
* One test on spec harness not passing, not accounting for edge case
* Nice separation of method and class responsibilities 
* Obvious strong effort toward refactoring -- with some small exception, Ruby syntax and style very strong (high 3)
* Consistently best choice enumerables


### 1. Functional Expectations
* 2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation
* 4: Zero complaints
