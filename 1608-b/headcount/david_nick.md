Notes:
* Harness has 1 failure, 1 error.
* testing has 40 runs, 117 assertions
* 99 percent coverate
* Some tests are not robust
* Check what you are actually testing
* look into other testing matchers to find ways to test things
* some logic in repos that ideally belong in the lower object level
* Reptition in code with load methods not pulled out
* Some methods are doing too much, pull functionality out into smaller methods
