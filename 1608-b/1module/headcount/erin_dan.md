Notes:

* did iteration 6
* no extensions
* spec harness compeltely passes
* 141 tests, 97 percent coverate
* 0 sanitzation errors
* project raises errors which is awesome
* really good consistent use of enumerables to test collections in testing.
* good use of modules, and raises throughout project.
* Some opportunities to refactor for clarity, use more predicate methods
when working with stupid long conditionals
