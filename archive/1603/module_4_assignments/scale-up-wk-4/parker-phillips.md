### Participation

Steady communication with Chris as well as communicating with Mark about confusions regarding the App, we have no applicable PR's at the moment as none of our code is working.

### Work Completed

I have done a lot of researching into ways to auth an ember app and attempted a spike using ember-simple-auth that was unsuccessful at this time.
