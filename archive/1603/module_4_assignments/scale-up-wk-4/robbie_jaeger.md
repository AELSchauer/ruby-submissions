# Scale Up Check In - Week 4

- [Project Spec: LookingFor](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/looking_for_project.markdown)

# Student Feedback

### Blog draft

My blog will be about D3, the surprises I encountered, and integrating with React:
* Going into this, my naive thought was that creating visualizations was just a matter of putting data through a library, and the library would provide you with styled plots (because of software I've worked with in the past)
* However, in reality, you are just manipulating DOM elements
* SVG elements make things more scalable, but it is still difficult to position them and apply data to them
* D3 combines DOM manipulation, SVG elements, and data transformations all in one library
* How to integrate D3 with React

### Hours

Document your general hours below (or planned hours)

- Pre-Work: Setting up the repos and going through the Creact tutorial took up most of my time
- Tuesday: Class time and self study researching what visualization tools are out there, and what plays nicely with React
- Wednesday: Class time and self study for D3 - went through tutorials and code alongs (to create some code pens), sketched some visualization ideas
- Thursday: Class time and looking through the back-end API code in order to get the data for the visualizations (historical timeline of open jobs for certain technologies is what I am aiming for)
- Friday: Guest speaker talks. Stubbing a D3 component in the React front-end. Getting the data prepared in the back-end application.
- Weekend:

### Participation

- Looked over [Brian's PR](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/pull/75), but it was fairly short and didn't have any comments since Lucy commented on what I also had a question about

- Reviewed the rules that Lucy put together for the style guide

### Work Completed

- Research work is completed. I feel like I have enough resources and a foundation of knowledge to move forward with shippable features

# Instructor feedback

### Week 4

150/150 points

### Blog Post Draft (25 Points)  

  * 25: Developer has **draft/outlines** for 2 small blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or one in depth blog post. Outline is reasonably in depth and shows research/thoughtfullness.

### Team Participation (50 points)

  * 50: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

### Hourly Work (25 points)

  * 25: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day (or has a plan to do so over the weekend). Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (50 points)

Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
