Evaluator: Jhun
Notes: - great test coverage
       - tests are granular and scoped to specific html ids and classes which I like a lot.
       - Model test test validations and attempts to create without required validations.
       - All the views. I mean all of them had a partial. I like that.
       - great pull request conversations about code
       - Models are strong with a little more effort could hit the 4 mark easily.

1. Feature Completeness

4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions

2. Views

4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present

3. Controllers

3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts

4. Models

3: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring

5. Testing

4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels

6. Usability

3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready


7. Workflow

4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
