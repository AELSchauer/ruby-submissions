## Notes

* Customer Workflow:
  * styling/ux solid
  * add to cart goes to the cart
  * remove from cart works
  * not found search looks good
  * proper search works well
  * cart adjustments and subtotals all work
  * placed order goes to reservation page
  * reserve the order with time
  * pickup times are exclusive
* Admin:
  * can view orders
  * can change the status of orders
  * can create a product
  * probably missing the edit functionality
* Testing
  * 81 pass, 0 fail
* Organization
  * 59+ PRs
  * Good looking Trello
  * lots of feature branches
