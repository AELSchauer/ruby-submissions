Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Functional Expectations

3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

6. View Layer

4: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers.

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

Workflow (NOT GRADED)

  3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
