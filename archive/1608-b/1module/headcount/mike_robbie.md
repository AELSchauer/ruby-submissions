Notes:
* test suite - 69 runs, 131 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 97% coverage
* test harness - 1 failure, 0 errors
* generally good separation of logic across different classes and modules
* test coverage is adequate, but could use more edge cases and unit tests
* sanitation failures due to long method names
