Notes:
* Really great job. Even though you feel like you wanted to do more, 
* I think this is still a really solid project considering you took the
* risk with React. 
* Used a lot of tools to stay organized which is great to see. This helped us
* figure out how to reset expectations and requirements when needed.
* Room for refactoring in the code, but understandable since you were using a
* framework you haven't used before.
* User Experience needs a little work, getting things lined up on a page
* but overall, still looks really great.
