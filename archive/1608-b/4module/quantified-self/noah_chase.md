Notes:

* We cut scope in the previous meeting, but ended with un-started cards and un-finished cards
* App functionality feels a bit "prototype" / rough
* Some calorie totaling
* We pushed off the removing
* Can change dates but not really update the meals and date-related info
* Nice in-place editing of foods and searching of the list
* A few tests in place but not a ton of coverage
* JS syntax is fine
* Would like to see a bit more use of OO-style JavaScript, breaking up functions and responsibilities
* Git looks good
* PMing shows progress but isn't quite clean -- break down stories into smaller pieces, finish them

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

- 2: Application is missing required functionality, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable

### Testing

- 2: More functionality implemented than tested or only uses one test type

### HTML/CSS/UI

- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.

### JS syntax and Style

- 2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.

### Git Workflow

- 3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

### Project Management

- 2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently. Many cards have no changes made to them
