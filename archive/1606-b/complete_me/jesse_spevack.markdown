Notes:
* Spec harness 2.3 seconds
* Good testing, could check for more edge cases
* Recursive methods are well done 
* Would liked to have seen a separate Trie class
* Some opportunities to refactor, we talked about predicate methods


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development


* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components


* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style


* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections


* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
