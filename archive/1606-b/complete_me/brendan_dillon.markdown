Notes:

* Spec harness passes, 41s.
* Uses some metaprogramming like ideas in order to insert
* Good out of the box thinking
* Would like to have seen a Trie class to abstract out a number of functions that are all in completeme
* Because of that completeme is a bit long
* But there are a good number of ideas broken out into small chunks.



## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations


* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
