Notes:

* Looking at CompleteMe
* Not a lot of internal tests but they pass
* Could use a little more testing of edge cases and abnormalities
* Implementation is very concise, overall good
* Able to write everything in about 100 lines
* Need to implement/try the spec harness

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
