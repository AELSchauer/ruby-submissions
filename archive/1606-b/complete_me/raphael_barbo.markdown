Notes:
* Spec harness passes in 3.45s
* No tests for node
* Needs better naming of tests
* Try to not use setup and extract things out of tests too much
* Dont use an instance variable to do a count, calculate it
* Looking for a separate trie to abstract out certain functions 
* Some long methods, some opportunities to refactor 
* Tests do use fixtures at time
