Notes:
* Code is broken out well. Just a few spots for improvement
 to break out methods a little bit more.
* Gap in UI where workouts page wasn't working
* Testing was overall good, but a few controllers and fitbit service needed
a little more testing. Discussed importance of TDD
* Overall, great project.
