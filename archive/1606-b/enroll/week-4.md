Notes:

I'll just ramble for a while. I've decided that you were given some above average difficulty, but not impossible tasks. Everyone complains about Josh Cheek's code, but I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility of things you'll find, especially in the open source world. I've found that gems and libraries are written by people that are just coding all the time, and they need to keep themselves interested.

The real struggle that I stepped into was process. Our goal was to simulate how projects are really done in the working world, and your process was holding you back. Communication between the different roles on the team, staff and student, was broken. People didn't know what others were thinking, how to get their questions across, or how to communicate progress and blockers. I can't say who's fault that is, but I'm big on personal responsibility, so I'll just say it was everyone's fault.

There are actually still improvements to be made to our communication and workflow. With all that said, I went back into manager mode, and I was strict about deliverables and adherence to the workflow I've communicated, and you guys bounced back quickly. I want you to ramp up even more in the last two weeks of the project, but I'm proud of what you delivered this week and how you delivered it. You're making lasting impact on your own careers, and the cogs that make Turing run.
