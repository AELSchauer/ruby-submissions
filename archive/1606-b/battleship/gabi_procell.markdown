Notes:

* Game does not play
* 20 tests, 10 fail
* Need to use a test runner rather than running individual files
* Seem to have come at it from a top-down approach, made some component plans,
but still worked myself into a corner
* Recommend doing 4-5 Exercism exercises this weekend


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 4. REPL Interface

* 1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together
