Notes:
- Missing 3-unit ship implementation
- Significant refactoring needed: long methods, need to extract methods, address single responsibility needs
- Otherwise thorough implementation of project
- STRONG use of TDD
- REPL interface solid

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections
2.5
* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

### 4. REPL Interface
* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components
2.5
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
