Notes:

* Struggled with concentration during the project
* 12 tests, 10 pass
* Went for a top-down approach that struggled
* Next time try a bottom up approach and build some small components to gain familiarity
* Not a lot of code/functionality to look at

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 4. REPL Interface

* 2: Application's REPL has some inconsistencies or rough edges

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
