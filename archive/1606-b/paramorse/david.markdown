Notes:
* completed I7
* 56 tests
* Singular test file
* Some opportunities to refactor some longer methods
* Definitely heading down the road of pulling things out to separate methods
* overall good project

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality


* 3: Application follows the complete spec and including I7


### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
