Notes:
* I7 partially complete.
* Tests could use some more edge cases, 
* testing in general only covers bare minimum data
* There is a good amount of repetition and redundancy in code

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to and back successfully


### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
