Notes:
- Need to use tests more to drive development. Six skipped tests
- Good attempt at breaking logic into components, some opportunities to extract function
- Some refactoring needed
- Good use of enumerables

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient given projet requirements.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
