Notes:
- Completed all iterations and extensions
- Abandoned tests, many skips
- Good basic use of SRP principle, some inconsistencies
- Some opportunities to refactor
- Good use of loops, overly reliant on loop do when more appropriate methods would work

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality *as well as* two extensions.

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient given projet requirements.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
