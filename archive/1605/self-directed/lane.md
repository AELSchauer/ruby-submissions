Assessor: Lane

Notes:

* Had some issues starting getting yelp api working
* Had planned to get an app which would allow  you to say yes or no to a restaurant and then at the end of the list of restaurants you would have a decision made on where to eat
* Core feature incomplete
* No other features
* TDD for what is here covers 95% of code - and the service test would be nice to assert return values - Does make assertions about keys that are returned
* Overall Code quality was good.
* User experience suffers because there is no feature. UI is not bad. Could be cleanup a little but a good attempt
