Notes:
* Good effort, would have liked to see maybe one more feature, but we talked
 about burnout and how real it is for you right now
* Testing was great, would have liked to see a little more testing for the
 randomness
* Code quality was good. A little struggle on breaking out the logic into the
 right model, controllers, etc.
* Recipe methods a little long, needed to be broken out and also pulled into a
 PORO
* Poor performance due to large amount of results coming back. Talked about
* caching, and pagination to optimize performance
