Notes:
* Completion is just not there. Project is more APICurious than a
 true personal project. Would have liked to see more functionality
* Code that was there was good. Still some opportunity to refactor into
 smaller methods.
* Testing was lacking. Were some files that probably needed to not be included
which could have made the testing higher, but it still might be below
85%. Would have liked to see more content coming back from api tested.

**1. Completion**

* 2: Developer completed most of the user stories and requirements set by the client.

**2. Organization**

* 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 1: Project lacks sufficient testing (under 85% coverage).

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

**2. Performance**

* 4: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.
