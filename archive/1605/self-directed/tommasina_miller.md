Notes:
* Functionality not all there. Can't consider it a complete project because
the app is only taking info from slack and posting it to a site. Would have
liked to see some sort of stats within slack or within the web app
* Testing is not there. Small attempt to get some testing in there but even the
feature tests were not robust enough.
* Code needs to be refactored in a lot of places
* A lot of code/files that are not being used should have been taken out prior
to eval
* Great to see that a big risk was taken with the slack api, but should have
scaled down on scope when it was taking too long to get everything
implemented. Because of the amount of time to figure out slack api, other
things suffered from that, like not having time to refactor and think about
where responsibilites should live within the code.
