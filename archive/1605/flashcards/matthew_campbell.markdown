Notes:
  - Fixing tests for later - will adjust score accordingly with fixed tests
  - Good use of setup method and sad path tests on round class
  - Could use some refactoring on big methods
  - Great work on extensions

* 4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality *as well as* two extensions.

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
