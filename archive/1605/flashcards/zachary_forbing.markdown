Notes:

* Overall solid project making good use of ruby fundamentals, demonstrating comfort and proficiency defining classes, defining methods,
tracking and updating instance variables, etc
* did good job managing the I/O throughout the program
* Enum capabilities seem to be coming along
* OOP structure is coming along, just still showing fairly large concentration of the program's overall logic into 1 dominant class,
talked about ways to start looking for that pattern and identify additional classes or methods that can be pulled out to share some of
this responsibilty.

Scores:


### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
