Repo: still having some github issues with account being flagged as a bot

Notes:

* Got partially through iteration 4 -- got the basic project structure setup, got the first layer of connections
between the various objects and have some good test covering these pieces
* am encouraged by your grasp of the TDD cycle, understanding how objects change within a test and how we can
use assertions to check or verify these changes
* main thing we need is just a lot more practice and to start going through this cycle more quickly and intuitively / naturally
* what we have is good, just need to get to the point we are producing much more of it during the time allotted

Scores:


### 1. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application is usable but has some missing functionality.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
