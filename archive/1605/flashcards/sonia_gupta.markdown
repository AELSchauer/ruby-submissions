Notes:

* clean and straightforward project structure
* demonstrating really solid ruby fundamentals and mechanics -- seems like you're much more comfortable now with defining classes,
defining methods, working instance variables, and tracing the interactions between a handful of classes
* especially like the amount and variety of the tests -- seems like you are giving a lot of attention to thinking about different scenarios,
trying out different inputs, etc etc
* looked at a couple small style points -- avoiding unnecessarily verbose boolean expressions and not forgetting about methods you already wrote
such that you end up reimplementing the same code in another place
* finally talked about using small I/O / display helper methods to help break up the structure of a large I/O-intensive loop

Scores:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
