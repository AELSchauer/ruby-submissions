Notes:

* solid project demonstrating competency with fundamental ruby concepts and mechanics of OOP
* looked a couple small ruby style points around boolean expressions; talked about consistently re-using method logic
that has already been implemented
* like seeing the enums you are using (lots of map, even a little zipping going on)
* going forward, bigger stylistic points we talked about involved avoid tracking unnecessary data in instance variables
and looking for opportunities to extract new classes with specific responsibilities wherever the opportunity arises
* testing is looking good, but would like to see more of it

Scores:


### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality *as well as* two extensions.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
