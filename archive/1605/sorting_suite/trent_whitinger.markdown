Notes:
* Rakefile, 19 tests all passing
* Very terse methods,
* look to refactor complex conditionals
* .dup wasn't necessary


### Functional Expectations

* 3: All three sort classes work as expected

### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### Ruby Style

* 3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase
