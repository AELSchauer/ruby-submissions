Notes:
* 47 tests, all passing, RAKEFILE!
* Benchmarks implemented, and implemented well.
* some opportunties to refactor for clarity
* Did modules and benchmarking

### Functional Expectations

* 4: All three sort classes work as expected with 2 or more extensions.

### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### Ruby Style

* 4: Any given chunk of code can be understood at a single level of abstraction

### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase
