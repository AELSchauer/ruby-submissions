### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback (links are nice)
Doing PR reviews were a little strange, since I didn't know the language too in-depth myself. I was able to contribute observations, but I couldn't catch the more subtle holes in the code.

People were really helpful in providing PR reviews. I was appreciative that a lot of grads were taking the time to chime in.

[Example 1](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/pull/91)

[Example 2](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/pull/87)



### Discuss: your experience doing blog and getting feedback (links are nice)

Doing the blog was a little difficult. It was hard for me to corral my thoughts in a coherent way while I was still learning. As I become a more experienced programmer, I look forward to being able to articulate my thoughts on programming clearer as well.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups:
I really enjoyed stand ups once we got organized and started being clear about
what we wanted to work on. Everyone was clear with their intentions and it was
easy to find places to explore interests.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

I would like to see the email feature implemented.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Instructor Evaluation:

Notes:

* overall I'd say you had a successful scale up. 
* I would have liked to see a little more in some areas like your PRs. They were a little sparce in your descriptions of what was the functionality for the PR. I would suggest you work on your documentation and PR submission technique. I am taking a few points for "detailed" Prs.
* I also took 2 out of 10 points away for your PR reviews. As you noted they were not 100% constructive - more observations
* Good blog and helpfull feedback
* 20 for risk taking and creativity because I think you took some risk, but mailer feature was not delivered and I do not see any documentation for next steps.
