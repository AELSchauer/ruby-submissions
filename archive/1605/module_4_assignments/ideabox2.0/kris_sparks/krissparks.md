## Completion

### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
* At this point a filtered search is not functional.

### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
* None

### Attach a .gif, or images of any extensions work being used on the site.

# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Code on Github](https://github.com/kbs5280/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/edit_idea.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
* I had to do some research, ask questions and be creative to solve this problem. I probably could have done better, but considering the limited amount of time and the amount of new material, I am proud of what I learned and accomplished independently.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Code on Github](https://github.com/kbs5280/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/quality_of_idea.js)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
* These functions are essentially the same and I feel confident they could be refactored. Given limited time and experience I was not able to gather the information I needed in one jQuery selector and AJAX call.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

 I wish that I had made more progress, especially finishing base functionality, and that my code was better. I learned a lot in 3 days. I am very concerned about my ability to learn enough JavaScript in the next week or two to be successful.


 * Idea bodies longer than 100 characters should be truncated to the nearest word. (5 points)


 (15 points total.)

 We'd like our users to be able to easily find specific ideas they already created, so
 let's provide them with a filtering interface on the idea list.

 * At the top of the idea list, include a text field labeled "Search". (3 points)
 * As a user types in the search box, the list of ideas should filter in real time to only display ideas whose title or body include the user's text. The page _should not_ reload. (6 points)
 * Clearing the search box should restore all the ideas to the list. (6 points)


 95 - 20 = 75

 75 + 44 = 119

 ### Specification Adherence

 44

 * **8 points**: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. There is no use of `format.js` in Rails. There is no use of unobstrusive JavaScript. There are no front-end frameworks used in the application. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

 ### User Interface

 * **3 points** - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

 ### Testing

 *7 - Tests at multiple levels - has controller/request tests, has some feature tests, but not for all features or actions in the controller

 * **8 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
 * **5 points** - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. Not all controller actions are tested. There are little or no attempts at integration testing.

 ### Ruby and Rails Quality

 * **8 points** - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

 ### JavaScript Style

 * **8 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

 ### Workflow

 * **10 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
