## Building activities and curriculum for Turing Outreach:
At Boys and Girls Club, we are experimenting with different things to engage kids in coding or problem solving. Sometimes the age can make a big difference and having a couple of options for activities can be good. We use [Make Your Own Website](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/outreach/hope_house.markdown) and also [Hour of Code](https://code.org/learn) coding games. We are trying to plan, structure and get feedback each time we do something there.

Another thing we are playing with at Boys and Girls club now is [Kodu game lab](https://www.kodugamelab.com). Kids can actually make games, but that might be more of a headache to load and require more patience and multiple sessions to actually create a project/game. It is a microsoft product, but it is pretty cool.

At Hope House when we taught a mix of adult and kids last module, a larger screen that someone can present on was helpful for those that might want to follow along with a step by step presentation of an exercise. When we go to schools or other places this may be a good strategy to present.

I am committed to continuing to do this kind of volunteer work and teaching after Mod 4. Ideally, Boys and Girls Club asks for at least one day a week commitments from volunteers. I can do this as an individual, but I would also like to keep working with Ken, who runs their computer lab, and build a relationship with the Boys and Girls Club of Denver & Turing School (including alumni, students and staff).
