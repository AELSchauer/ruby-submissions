### Which Assignments and Why?
- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?
- The Side Hustle Assignment
- The Dangerous Denver Assignment

- Why did you choose these assignments?
I chose the Side Hustle assignment because I have a side project or two
where most of the hard work is already done, but could really use some polish
in order to show off to employers.

I chose the Dangerous Denver Assignment because I'd like to keep my
skills sharp, and it would be nice to not have to come up with a new
project idea.
