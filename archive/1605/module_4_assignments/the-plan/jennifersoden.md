### Which Assignments and Why?
- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?
* Goals
* Community Involvement

- Why did you choose these assignments?
  I chose goals because I think it's a good idea to think about what I would like to accomplish in the next year even if it's not too detailed at first. It's something I can point to and say, I have made progress on this thing. I feel like job hunting may start feeling aimless and pointless so it's important to remember things that I'd like to do.

  I chose community involvement because I believe it can be something to do to leave my apartment once in awhile, which is healthy. I also tend to get depressed if I'm cut off from people for too long, so I think it's important to get out and be social.
