### Which Assignments and Why?
- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?
  - [Dangerous Denver](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/module_4_assignments/the-plan/assignments/dangerous-denver.markdown)
  - [Community Involvement](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/module_4_assignments/the-plan/assignments/community-involvement.markdown)
- Why did you choose these assignments?
  - My experience with JavaScript thus far has been very application specific (IdeaBox, Gametime). Additionally, there are so many frameworks and libraries within the JavaScript world that, at this point in my understanding, I find the initial start to be difficult. My hope is that Dangerous Denver will allow me a structured means of using JavaScript in a manner in which I am already comfortable with Ruby.
  - Community involvement will likely be key to not only getting my first job but career mobility once somewhat established. Additionally, I believe I have a good ability for explaining concepts, and I enjoy helping others. I will continue blogging on a regular basis, typically doing a post as I learn a new topic. Additionally, I would like to become more comfortable in giving talks. I will explore this initially through local meetups, likely in the beginners track.

### Submitted Assignments

#### Goal One - Scale up on CS fundamentals
- State where you are currently at with this goal
  - I will be receiving recommended resources from a potential employer, and I have a book that was recommended by a mentor. Progress on this goal will begin post-graduation.
- Define what success looks like after 1 year
  - Comfortable with common CS algorithms and able to leverage understanding in how software interacts at a hardware level when making coding decisions.
- Outline resources for learning
  - List books, blogs, talks, podcasts and courses that would be useful in learning more
    - [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0262640686/)
    - Additional online resources will be supplied by a potential employer in the coming days
  - List mentors you know or places you could find mentors who could help you along the way
    - Mike Pack
- Why is this goal important to you?
  - I am grateful for the learning I have achieved at Turing, but I know it is the tip of the iceberg, and many theoretical topics were not explored, due to the short-term nature of the program. I think it is important to be well-rounded as a developer, and this learning will help me to make more informed decisions with regards to the code I write.

#### Goal Two - Continue learning Elixir and Phoenix
- State where you are currently at with this goal
  - I have completed the official getting started guide and tutorial, completed a rudimentary CLI app, and posted a blog exploring five key elements of Elixir. I have also attended an Elixir meetup.
- Define what success looks like after 1 year
  - Fluent enough in the language to recognize it as a tool, where appropriate, and have at least one respectable project under my belt.
- Outline resources for learning
  - List books, blogs, talks, podcasts and courses that would be useful in learning more
    - Udemy Elixir/Phoenix course (I already have access to this course)
    - Monthly Elixir/Phoenix meetup
  - List mentors you know or places you could find mentors who could help you along the way
    - Jessica Goulding
- Why is this goal important to you?
  - I am interested in functional programming, and this is a language and framework that shares similarities with Ruby and Rails while being functional and concurrent. Additionally, I have access to a Turing mentor and local meetup that will assist in my learning.

#### Goal Three - Gain employment with an employer that aligns with my goals and interests
- State where you are currently at with this goal
  - I have researched and had coffee with a number of companies.
- Define what success looks like after 1 year
  - Employment (maybe not my first job) with a company that is a good fit of my values and interests. Good work-life balance.
- Outline resources for learning
  - List mentors you know or places you could find mentors who could help you along the way
    - Mike Pack
- Why is this goal important to you?
  - Why would this goal _not_ be important to me?
