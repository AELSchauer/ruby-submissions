### Game Name

Empty Calorie Adventure

### Description
Gametime is a Module 4 project at Turing. We are building a game with a healthy eating theme. This game will eventually be included in our Pahlka Posse's healthy eating app for children.


### Game components
The goal of the game is for the player to collect as much health food as possible while avoiding the junk food.
The game consists of an overlord who spits out junk food, the tray for collecting the food, and falling health food. The variation in points for the health food reflects their respective ORAC scores.


### How it relates to Pahlka
This game will include references to health food's nutritional value and will hopefully leave players with an idea of how to best choose foods for their health benefits.
We intend for this game to be played by children with their parents as a part of a larger narrative game that discusses the merits of healthy lifestyles.
