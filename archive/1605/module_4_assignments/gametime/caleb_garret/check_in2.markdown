### GOAL 2: Bullet class unit tested

  - [Link to bullet test](https://github.com/Caleb9193/gametime/blob/master/test/bullet_test.js#L7)
  - Struggling with testing the `draw` function. Could use some guidance.

### GOAL 3: Limit number of ricochets

  - [Link to `if` block](https://github.com/Caleb9193/gametime/blob/master/lib/index.js#L25)
  - [Link to `bounceCount` counter](https://github.com/Caleb9193/gametime/blob/master/lib/bullet.js#L10)
  - Is there a better way to handle shooting a single bullet at a time?

## Next Steps?

  - Creating a __Start Game__ button
  - Ending the game/round once ammo is empty or level is complete (Create a __Retry__ / __Score: x__ prompt)
  - Aiming with the mouse
  - Obstacles (collision detection)
  - Targets (collision detection)

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
