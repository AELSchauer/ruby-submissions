# Game Time Check In # 1

## Basics

### Team
- [Yoseph Anderson](https://github.com/Yoyo2Code)
- [Zack Forbing](https://github.com/zackforbing)

### Game Name

TimeFreeze

### Give a Basic Description of the Game

a basic shooter game with a timey-wimey twist - when you arent moving, time stands still...to a point. if you sit still too long, time starts to fall apart behind you! see how many virtual representations of objects and creatures you can blow up before they get you!

### Include a Link to or Screen Shot of the Game

[here is a video of the original game in motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKHNcYV1FNU)

## The Plan

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- player can move around an environment, but is stationary on screen
- player shoots bullets automatically
- enemies are defeated by hitting them with bullets
- enemies are worth points
- difficulty (eg, enemy count) ramps up as you cross "hurdles" worth increasing number of points
- if you collide with an enemy you will die
- local high scores

### What are your 'Dream Features' that you'd like to add if time allows?

- player can pick up points and weapons
- differently colored enemies behave differently
- if you stand still too long, the environment disappears underneath you and you die
- time only moves as fast as you do...you can stop time by stopping, and slow time by not moving as fast
- cool graphics, with particle effects/screen shake on death
- firebase for cross-player high scores

### What have you accomplished so far?

we have some player tests written, a background class created, and a player class created.

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

can we use libraries for certain things? (particle generation, collision detection, etc)
