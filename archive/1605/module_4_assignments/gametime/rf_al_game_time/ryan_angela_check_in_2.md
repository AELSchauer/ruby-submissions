### Goal 1: Placeholder obstacles (no collision detection)

  - Provide a screenshot or gif or link to code for this goal

  - Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
    * No, we stuck to what was originally discussed.
  - Questions, Comments, Concerns?
    * We still have some concerns regarding performance, but these issues are not consistent.

### Goal 2: Jeepney jumps

- Provide a screenshot or gif or link to code for this goal
  * [Link to a low quality GIF of that beauty jumping](http://recordit.co/iwfoHRO5Y4)
- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
  * No, we stuck to what was originally discussed.
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?
  * Mildly concerned about getting collision detection working with objects that are not visually complete squares or rectangles, but happy with the jump mechanics thus far.

### Goal 3: Background objects move to indicate jeepney movement

- Provide a screenshot or gif or link to code for this goal
  * See link to GIF for Goal 2.
- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
  * No, we stuck to what was originally discussed.
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?
  * N/A

### Goal 4 (stretch goal): Collision detection between jeepney and obstacles

- Provide a screenshot or gif or link to code for this goal
  * [Link to low quality GIF of collision](http://recordit.co/0VoLac45nx)
- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
  * Not entirely, but this current implementation is a first draft. We still need to fully test this functionality, add movement (in place of disappearance) to objects collided with, and clean up the collision so that it works from all angles correctly.
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?
  * Same general concern as Goal 2.

## Next Steps?

- What do you feel the next steps should be?
  * Implement game start and game end functionality
  * Implement game scoring and visual health loss functionality
  * Implement bonus items and health gain functionality
  * Implement local storage high score functionality
  * Find additional sprites to diversify the background objects and obstacles
  * Add sound effects / music

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
* None at this time.

# Instructor Section

### Points for Second Check In (base 50)

* 60 points: Students documented their work well and completed all base goals or have documented where/why they deviated from the goal in a reasonable way. Students completed additional stretch goals.
* 50 points: Students documented their work well and completed all base goals or have documented where/why they deviated from the goal in a reasonable way.
* 35 points: Students completed all base goals but did not document the work appropriately in their form || did not complete 1 goal and failed to document why in a reasonable way.
* 25 points: Students did not complete more than 1 goal.
* 0 points: Students did not complete check in form prior to eval.

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

* Goal 1: Finish collision detection and add desired reactions to obstacles and jeepney

* Goal 2: start screen / end or restart game screen

* Goal 3: scoring points and highscore functionality

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_

### Stretch Goals

* current health and current score accumulator implimented
