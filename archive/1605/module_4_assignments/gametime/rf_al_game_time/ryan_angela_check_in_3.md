# Game Time Check In # 3

## Instructor Goal Completion

### Goal 1: Finish collision detection and add desired reactions to obstacles and jeepney

  - [Link to low-quality GIF demonstrating reactions](http://recordit.co/UsaSotHR56)
  - Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
    - No, we followed the plan we originally started with.
  - Questions, Comments, Concerns?
    - Learned a lot about the starting x and y values for `drawImage()`!

### Goal 2: Start screen / end or restart game screen

  - [One-low quality GIF to rule them all (it's the same as the first one)](http://recordit.co/UsaSotHR56)
  - Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
    - No, but there is additional work that we'd like to do here.
  - Questions, Comments, Concerns?
    - None at this time.

### Goal 3: Scoring points and high score functionality

  - [One low-quality GIF to rule them all (it's the same as the first two)](http://recordit.co/UsaSotHR56)
  - Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
    - No.
  - Questions, Comments, Concerns?
    - None at this time.

### Goal 4 (stretch): Implement current health and current score accumulator

- [Really getting a lot of mileage out of this low-quality GIF](http://recordit.co/UsaSotHR56)
- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
  - Somewhat. We had originally anticipated tying the scoring to avoiding obstacles; however, as our difficulty increases, it's truly the speed that is increasing, and what we really care about is time survived. As such, scoring is now tied to time survived, knowing that avoiding obstacles is a prerequisite for survival.
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?
  - None at this time.

## Next Steps?

- Automatically increasing difficulty (speed)
- Revise game start/end to live entirely within the canvas, include instructions
- Add additional obstacle (street dog)
- Add bonus items (ability to earn back health / points if at full health)
- Add sound effects / music
- Beautify

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
- Pushing to GitHub Pages seems to lose all styling and JS. Solutions found on Google involve installing a dependency via npm, whereas previous iterations of Game Time seem to have not required this.

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

These goals should center around wrapping up the game:

- Some way of increasing difficulty
- Making the game compelling for players
- Making sure the README and other documentation is up to snuff
- Making sure the game is deployed
