### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

These goals should center around wrapping up the game:

 - Matching the [rubric](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown) requirements
 - Refactoring/Cleaning up test coverage
 - Making the game compelling for players
 - Making sure the README and other documentation is up to snuff
 - Making sure the game is deployed

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_
