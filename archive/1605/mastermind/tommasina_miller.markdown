Notes:

* didn't finish mastermind but did make some solid progress on some of the small pieces
* needed a few more pieces filled in to put it all together
* low-level mechanics seem to be coming along pretty well -- effectively putting together ruby expressions, working with methods, arguments, etc
* talked to tommasina about what is going well and what needs more practice -- just needs a few more pieces in the toolbox and more practice with some of the fundamental concepts
* continue to focus especially on the idea of "state" (i.e. instance variables); over time will develop a more fundamental understanding of these principles and how to manipulate them
* talked to tommasina about moving to foxtrot and i think we both agree this will be the best move for her

Scores: N/A didn't complete
