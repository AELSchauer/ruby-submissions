Notes:

* solid implementation that works with base cases as well as handling multiple difficulty levels
* gave attention to several of the edge cases that could come up along -- validating guess lengths etc
* talked about design-oriented next steps -- what would it look like to pull out more classes from the program
* what would it look like to reorganize the way the game accomplishes its looping structure
* low-level fundamentals and mechanics seem solid -- should put you on a good footing for doing more complex projects during the module

Scores:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections

### 3. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.
