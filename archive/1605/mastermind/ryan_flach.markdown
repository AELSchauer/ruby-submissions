Notes:
* good breakdown of responsibiliies in to disparate clases
* really liked class methods in Communication class, though would like to have
seen more messages printed out to the screen in there for consistency and
organization's sake.
* Some opportunities to refactor for clarity.
* Methods on the whole were nicely short.
* Think more about how you can rewrite your methods so that they take
arguments and return values rather that modifying an instance variable.
* Remember that instance variables shouldn't change often.
