Notes:
* Email extension and Stripe
* Views need refactoring - logic in the views - understand why this is not okay
* Controllers have some logic - need refactored
* Models look great
* Need some sad path tests
* Good work on workflow
* User experience could be improved by more styling

## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

### 1. Feature Completeness

* 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions

### 2. Views

* 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through

### 3. Controllers

* 3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts

### 4. Models

* 4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features

### 5. Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

### 6. Usability

* 3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready

### 7. Workflow

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
