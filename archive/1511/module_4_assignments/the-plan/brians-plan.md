### Which Assignments and Why?

__Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?__

- The goal setting assignment and the job hunting.

__Why did you choose these assignments?__

- I chose the goal setting choice because I wanted to set down some actionable steps to follow for furthering the breadth of my programming skills.

- I chose the Job Hunt assignment because the biggest hurdle I have it where to pour my energy toward. After many hours of researching companies I feel good about the 5 I documented and ended up with many more bookmarked job postings.
