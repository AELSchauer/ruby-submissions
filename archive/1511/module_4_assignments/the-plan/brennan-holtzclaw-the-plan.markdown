### Which Assignments and Why?
- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?
  * I chose to do the "Goals" and "Side Hustle" assignments.

- Why did you choose these assignments?
  * The goals assignment was required, but as I filled it out I realized that several of my goals are linked tightly to building a side-project.
  Turing has taught me a project based approach to learning anyway, which is probably what's rubbing off here.
  It just seems like Side-Hustles are the best way to keep learning and honing.
