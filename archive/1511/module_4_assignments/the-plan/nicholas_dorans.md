# Name: Nicholas Dorans

### Which Assignments and Why?
- I chose to do The Plan (mostly because it was required) and The Side Hustle.
- The Plan and The Side Hustle are going to be great for me to give myself things to do over the next year. Coming from Turing, I now feel uncomfortable without constant pressure to do something. I want to keep a very high furious pace of coding going forward, so that I stay sharp with my coding skillz.
