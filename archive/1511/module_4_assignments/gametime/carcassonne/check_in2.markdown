### Points for Second Check In (base 50)
52/50

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In
- have 2 players
- Players take turns placing tiles and helpers on the board
- the board/UI has some sort of visual indicator to show which player is active

- have and place specific players meeples
- Board shows number of followers available for each player and the number of tiles remaining

- A pop up box of rules of the game that player can use, open, close, etc.
- starting page/screen with logo where players enter their names and can start the game

### Extension
- some test coverage
- players have the ability to increase and increase their own score (players control this themselves, the game doesn't automatically score at this point)

### Feedback?
This looks great! I'm really excited to see it with meeples and more than one player.
