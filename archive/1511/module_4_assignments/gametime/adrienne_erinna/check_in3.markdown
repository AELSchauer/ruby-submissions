Find it [here!](http://adriennedomingus.github.io/bubble_bobble/)

### GOAL 3
- Bob's Scores & Lives: See Levels Gif above: it's in the top left corner.

### GOAL 4
- End Game Sequence: again, see above gif.

### GOAL 5
-  Lock in code or visualization: Visualization is locked in. Code still has minor issues, but we're redirecting our attention - see next section.

## Next Steps?

- We're planning on transferring this over to a MEAN stack. Not sure how long that will take, but additional stuff includes two players (starting on same machine with different key bindings to get the prototype set up with two dinosaurs, and then transferring to Websockets as time allows)

50/50

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

The game is currently in a format where it meets the feature functionality - so additional work is towards an extension

Only requirement: Beef up README - point out research you did to make this a throwback game

UI Suggestion (NOT REQUIREMENT) - more details to show the user moving through levels

Suggest trying the MEAN stack as an extension and documenting the change from one to the other - especially in a blog post - to make this into a great portfolio piece. Since we don't have any major work this weekend, you'd have flexibility to wrap up that extension if desired.
