## Completion

### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
* Yes.

# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
* [happy code](CODECLIMATE_REPO_TOKEN=7ee4764d4423144e2c116494a5a7971a4ccf97536125f0c96087a87b2503d1c4 bundle exec rake)
* I am proud of this whole file. It originally had so much duplication in it that I wanted to vomit. I think the original file was around 200 lines long. I had never refactored js code before and with this I was able to write some functions that could be reused and move things around way more logically. It was very rewarding to see the final product.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

* [not so happy code](https://github.com/adamhundley/revenge_of_idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/voteAndDeleteIdeas.js#L11)
* I would've loved to divide some of this out into separate functions as well as re-use code between upvote and downvote, but ran into issues with the return value from the post request as well knowing what the actual idea was. In hindsight, I could've made a vote action and cut down on a lot of duplication.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

* [unhappy path](https://github.com/adamhundley/revenge_of_idea_box/blob/master/spec/features/user_edits_title_and_body_spec.rb#L30)
* An issue I was running into was once I edited a body, it wasn't being truncated anymore. This test verified truncation was happening after an edit if it hadn't been truncated on page load

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I really enjoyed this project and being able to learn so much about Javascript in such a short period of time. I finally feel comfortable writing it and not just copy pasta from the internet.

### Instructor Evaluation Points

#### Specification Adherence

10 points: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. There is no use of format.js in Rails. There is no use of unobstrusive JavaScript. There are no front-end frameworks used in the application. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

5 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

#### Testing

10 points - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels including JavaScript tests.

#### Ruby and Rails Quality

8 points - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### JavaScript Style

8 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

10 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
