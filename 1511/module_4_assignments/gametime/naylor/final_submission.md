## Completion

### Do You Consider the Application to be Fully Playable?
 - Yes. We fixed all bugs around collision detection. We have a definite beginning and end. Also, the game gets increasingly difficult as it goes on.

### What Extensions, as Requested By an Instructor, Did You Complete?
- Per Extension:
  - We were given a stretch goal of having a third level. We added the third level and made it super difficult to complete. All targets move.

### What Features, if Any, Do You Feel Exceed Instructor Expectations?
- Per Feature:
 - Not sure if anything exceeds instructor expectations

----

## Risk Taking
- The risks that we took on this project were mainly getting the trajectory of the cannon ball to look realistic and mimic gravity.
- We feel the risk was well worth it. It took us a long time in the beginning to figure that out, but we did it. We then tinkered with it til it was just right.

## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
- Why were you proud of this piece of code?
- [super clean index.js](https://github.com/Tman22/game-time/blob/master/lib/index.js#L1-38)

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
- Nothing really comes to mind, but I'm sure you will tell us what's wrong. Mainly we're just a little bummed that we couldn't get the high score board implemented but we'll do it in the next few days just for funzies.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

### Test Breakdown
- 55 Unit tests
- ![55](http://g.recordit.co/j5jSxrG6bN.gif)

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a unit test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'
- [Crucial Unhappy Paths](https://github.com/Tman22/game-time/blob/master/test/collision_test.js#L10-38)
- These tests were crucial for figuring out what was wrong with our collision detection woes.

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a feature test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

## Instructor Feedback

- Points: (base 300)

#### Playability Features

We want your game to be full-featured and playable -- not just a proof of concept of the gameplay and rendering features.

To this end, make sure to include sufficient UX to allow the user to fully interact with the game. This would include:

Indicate when the game is over and won or lost
Allow the user to start a new game
Include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself
Score Tracking: How this works will vary by game, but at the end of the game, generate a score for the winning player
Scoreboard -- track scores across multiple game sessions. Since we aren't incorporating a server for our games, client-side storage like a cookie or LocalStorage will suffice.
Create multiple rounds of difficulty. (consider increasing factors such as game speed, randomness of starting setup, etc)

#### Extensions

Create an AI player that can play as the second player (except in 2048).
Multiplayer support -- either by sharing a keyboard (2 sets of key inputs) or, as an extra-difficult extension, via websockets between multiple browsers
Evaluation Rubric

There are 300 total available points for this project.

150 are available at each of three check-ins and are at instructor descretion.

Teams must complete the submission form prior to each check-in.

150 out of a total of 300 points are included in the rubric below. The additional 150 feature points will be determined during iteration planning with instructors during check-ins.

#### Functional Expectations

35 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors

#### User Interface

13 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

#### Testing

30 points - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite convers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.
25 points - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
10 points - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
0 points - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

#### JavaScript Style

30 points - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or now duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
20 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
15 points - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or major bugs.
5 points - Your client-side application does not function. Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity.
0 points - There is little or no client-side code. Developer writes code that is difficult to understand. Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together.

#### Workflow

25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
15 points - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
10 points - The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
5 points - The developer commited the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
0 points - The application was not checked into version control.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

15 points - Zero complaints
10 points - Five or fewer complaints
5 points - Six to ten complaints
0 points - More than ten complaints
