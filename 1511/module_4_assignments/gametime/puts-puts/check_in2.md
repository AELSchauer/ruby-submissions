### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

* We would like to incorporate more and more robust tests.
+ get sinon working
+ catch up on testing, beef up test suite

* Clicking to hit the ball should actually make sense
+ controll ball speed
+ control ball angle

* Build first course
+ more complex course to make sure behavior is working as expected
+ Have a level done, defined by clicking the ball, playing until the ball is the hole, and getting a score
+ display score/number of points

### Possible extension for next time (not required): 
* arrow that indicates direction of ball travel
* a "play gome" start up screen that lets you begin play and has directions for how to play.
