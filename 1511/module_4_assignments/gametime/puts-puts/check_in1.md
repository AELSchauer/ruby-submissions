## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product
* Player can swing a club, with visual indication of strength and angle
* Terrain can be flat or angled, indicated by a gradient for the hills
* Strokes are tracked and scored once a ball makes it to the hole (golf scoring, with points based on being over par)
* Sand trap is indicated by a different color/gradient and slows down the speed
* A ball hit into a water trap disappears and reappears at the edge of the water closest to where it went in and player receives +1 to strokes
* Score is tracked with a chart on top of the screen for each hole
* Bumpers obstruct the ball and deflect in an angled direction
* Tunnels: When a ball disappears in a hole other than the final hole, it reappears at a matching hole on a different green
* Windmills: spinning bumpers that block the tunnel to the final hole
* Courses can be procedurally generated

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?
* 3 holes that don't break!
* Visual indicator of power/angle gauge on the club
* Obstacles would include: bumpers
* score board

### What have you accomplished so far?
* collison detection against canvas walls
* obstacle objects
* ball object
* ball move on click event

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?
* problems related to collision detection against obstacles. Is it due to tunneling

## Instructor Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)

50/50

### Instructor's goals for next check in


- Clicking on the ball gives it a constant speed
- Clean up the bumper boundaries so that ball doesnâ€™t go through
- Set up and have a few initial tests to drive collision detection

### Extensions

- Stops at the hole and game in some way reacts
- Slowing down over time

### Feedback?

Great progress so far!
