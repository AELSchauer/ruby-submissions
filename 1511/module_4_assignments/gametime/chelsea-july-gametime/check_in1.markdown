## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Nyan cat moves up and down on the left side of the screen
- Background is 8-bit outer space
- It moves up or down to eat candy and avoid veggies.
- You gain points for every piece of candy you eat
- You start with three lives
- If you eat a veggie, you lose a life. Once all three lives are gone, game over
- Every time you eat a veggie, a message appears (ex: "cabbage, yuck! -10 points")
- If you eat 10 pieces of candy, you get a life back (can have a max of 3)
- If you gain 200 points, you progress to a new level. Items appear more quickly and there are more veggies to avoid.
- Turing mode- you avoid Allans and try to eat Julians
- Jorge mode- you eat burritos and don't avoid anything
- Konami code- surprise!
- Fancy mode- piano music and Nyan cat has a tophat

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?
