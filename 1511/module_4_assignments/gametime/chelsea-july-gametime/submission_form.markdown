## Completion

### Do You Consider the Application to be Fully Playable?

 - Yes, very user friendly and easy to understand! Simply move up and down and use spacebar to deploy bombs.

### What Extensions, as Requested By an Instructor, Did You Complete?

- We discussed hiding an API key which we were able to successfully complete. We also discussed having lasers or bombs- we decided on bombs. July also worked on having a moving cat gif to the game- adds a lot! Moving background was also  not completely necessary but it adds a lot to the experience.
- See above gif for bombs and moving cat gif. We wouuld add a link to how we hid API key, but it's in .gitignore- SUCCESS!


### What Features, if Any, Do You Feel Exceed Instructor Expectations?

 - Bombs, cat gif, audio, and moving background. See above gif!

## Risk Taking

- What risks did you feel you took on this project?

Adding a moving background involved stacking two canvases on top of each other and increasing overall complexity of the game. Moving cat gif also increased complexity for collision and drawing the object.

- How do you feel about those risks?

Learned a lot from them! Glad we did them.

## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

[ScoreboardHelpers](https://github.com/cheljoh/game-time/blob/master/lib/scoreboard-helpers.js#L1-L29)
- Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Small functions that assist the Scoreboard class. Easier to test.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

[refreshSprites](https://github.com/cheljoh/game-time/blob/master/lib/game.js#L63-L86)

- Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

This is a important function that is long by necessity and difficult to test. We broke out as many functions as we could.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
