## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

[code](https://github.com/damwhit/helicopter-time/blob/master/lib/game.js)

[code](https://github.com/damwhit/helicopter-time/blob/master/index.html)
- Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
