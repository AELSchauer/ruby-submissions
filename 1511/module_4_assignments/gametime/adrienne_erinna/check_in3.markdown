Find it [here!](http://adriennedomingus.github.io/bubble_bobble/)

### GOAL 3
- Bob's Scores & Lives: See Levels Gif above: it's in the top left corner.

### GOAL 4
- End Game Sequence: again, see above gif.

### GOAL 5
-  Lock in code or visualization: Visualization is locked in. Code still has minor issues, but we're redirecting our attention - see next section.

## Next Steps?

- We're planning on transferring this over to a MEAN stack. Not sure how long that will take, but additional stuff includes two players (starting on same machine with different key bindings to get the prototype set up with two dinosaurs, and then transferring to Websockets as time allows)
