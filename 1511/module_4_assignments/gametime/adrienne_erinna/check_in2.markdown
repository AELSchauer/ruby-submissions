# Game Time Check In # 2

## Instructor Goal Completion
* General note: I (Adrienne) suck at this game. Don't judge me from these gifs.

### GOAL 1
  - Dinosaur vs bubble collision detection (bubble "pops" (disappears) when the dino collides with it).

### GOAL 2

- Wind up toys vs dinosaur collision detection (Dino loses a life. That has no repercussions yet, but it will! There is a 'timeout' period after he loses a life where he is immune. There will be visual demonstration of this as well.)

### GOAL 3

A lot of goals, all in one Gif:
- Wind up toys and bubble collision detection
- Wind up toy functionality:
  - Fall from sky and walk
  - In bubble floats up
  - Toys/Bubbles can be popped

(That's fruit falling from the sky, obviously)

## Next Steps?

- Visualization: make windups and fruit and bubbles look like windups and fruit and bubbles
- Levels. Shouldn't be too much of a stretch from current implementation of floors.
- Deploy
- Showing the Bob's scores and lives
- End game sequence

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
* Testing "private" methods on a constructor/what to expose.
* Resources for deploying
* Local Storage for scoring?
