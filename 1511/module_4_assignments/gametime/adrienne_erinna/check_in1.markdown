## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Dinosaur jumps and shoots bubbles
- These bubbles can capture windup toys
- Windup toys follow the dinosaur
- Dinosaur loses a life if windup toys hit him
- Bubbles float to the top
- Level ends when all windup toys are captured in bubbles and popped
- Bubbles generate goodies when popped and these goodies can be captured for points
- Levels have "floors" which you can jump through and land on
- Multiple levels with different configurations: future levels have wrap around and weird weird scenarios
- Two player friendly competitive play mode

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?
- Dinosaur can shoot bubbles
- Level is encapsulated on the screen (i.e. there are boundaries)
- Windup toys go back and forth without deviation
- Dinosaur can lose life if collides with windup toy
- Dinosaur can jump and pop bubbles
- Bubbles give goodies and dinosaur can collect them for points

### What have you accomplished so far?
- Dinosaur can move back and forth on screen
- Dinosaur can shoot bubbles
- Dinosaur can jump up and down but not super smoothly
- Bubbles can move outwards and float, and they collect at the top of the screen
- Unit tests on Bubble and Dinosaur

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?
- How many levels should we build?
- Test gaps: button pressing and the drawing.
