  * No deviation, currently in the process of creating a GameEngine class that uses
  duck typing to render all of the assets with one command.
  * How hard is it to make sprites?

### Ability to control multiple Bomber Persons on the map

* No real instructions to handle multiple inputs from the keyboard. Lot's of Stack Overflow
and googling. You can check out the implementation in the pic above.
* None, unless Alan has questions that I do not know of.

### Render blocks on the board

* Haven't gotten to rendering all the blocks on the board so nothing to really
talk about yet
* None at the moment

### Populate board with blocks on initial render

* Did not get to this goal as of yet. Almost there though! :(

## Next Steps?

* Populating the board with blocks
* Making sure that Bomber Persons cannot walk over the blocks
* Creating the Bomb class
* Creating the Explosion class
* Making sure that explosion "clears" any tile that have a bomber person, block, etc...
* Bomber Person can drop bomb

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
* How to implement websockets for multiplayer support
