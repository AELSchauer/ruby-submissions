## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

e.g.

* 4 player using web sockets
* Power-ups
* Ability to "kick" bombs
* Can drop bombs. Bombs will ignite other bombs
* Block are destroyed when a bomb hits it
* Bomber Person is destroyed when hit by a bomb
* Last 30 seconds the map begins to shrink
* Scoreboard (best of 5?)
* When you die, you have the ability to throw bombs. If you kill a Bomber Person
while throwing a bomb you then switch with them.
* Game settings
* Some sort of invitation system? Rooms?
* Chat
* Different levels
* Different skins (bomber person, bombs, etc...)

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

* Local two player
* Can drop bombs. Bombs will ignite other bombs
* Block are destroyed when a bomb hits it
