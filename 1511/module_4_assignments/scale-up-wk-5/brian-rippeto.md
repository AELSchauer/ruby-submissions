### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks
- I tackled the large majority of styling with react-bootstrap. This was a weak point in my skill set and I feel I largely improved my CSS skills throughout this project. There were many requests for small changes from my team that I was able implement in a timely manner.
- Search by technologies feature.
- Paired with partners on  refactoring and testing.
- Gave thorough PR reviews and took part in meaningful discussion though out the process.
- Coordinating with backend team on endpoint formatting

### Hours logged this week?

- 30.5


### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.

- I had not used the react-rails gem before and it was fun an interesting to learn how to implement React within a Rails app. It was a great learning experience to be able to run through that methodology and then build out our application in pure Node.js.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

[React with Bootstrap blog](https://medium.com/@brianrip22/react-with-bootstrap-894c39d4d7dd#.xfydiijiv)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

- This was the most thorough I have been on PR reviews during my time at Turing. Our process was that if possible every team member would review each PR. At first I thought this to be overkill and slowing our ability to progress production but It served to be useful as we refactored code before merging to production. At times, I think we could have merged branched more expediently and addressed the suggestions in a separate issue so that we could all have an up to date MVP. There were a few times where we dealt with unnecessary merge conflicts to to delayed PRs.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

- Stand ups served as an opportunity to stay in touch with the backend team and flush out needed conversation. I enjoyed being able to weigh options and be included in the decision making process of features that I wasn't necessarily working on.

### What features would you like to see LookingFor have in the future?

- I would like to see LookingFor state the source of the job posting on the listing.
- The ElasticSearch fuzzy search would also be useful as it would allow search by company name.
- A logo
- An account to save favorited jobs.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

- I took on the styling portion of this project which was great but feel I could have done more in the realm of React. I am hoping to spend more time on React this week to have a even more solid React foundation. Really love the the client side approach.
