Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

Over the last two weeks I have been creating a React App that serves as the UI for and hits the rails API that I built last module. I have been able to display dynamic data and routes using react-router.  I currently only have an index and show page for plants but plan to implement recipe functionality as well.

Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

I learned that it is difficult to pass data between react components if you are rendering them on different routes and you are not using JSX - check out mah [blog](https://medium.com/@damwhitaker/how-not-to-pass-data-between-react-components-b9df64a47d5a#.hh9qip1zj) to see how to do it both the incorrect and correct way.

Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

Giving PR reviews is hard as it is difficult to know everything that is going on in someone else's codebase.  I really enjoyed both receiving and giving feedback and even attempted pulling down Scott's codebase to try to help him fix a bug this week.  Looking forward to working in a PR review system on the job as I can see how it will be very beneficial in helping me grow as a programmer.

Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

I had a great time participating in daily standups.  It is cool to see what everyone else is working on and it is nice to see if you can offer or possibly ask for guidance from your peers.  Definitely liked staying up to date on everyone else's projects.
