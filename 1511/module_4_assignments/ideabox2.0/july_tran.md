### Attach a .gif, or images of any extensions work being used on the site.

# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
* [This file](https://github.com/julyytran/ideabox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/render-ideas.js) is clean and broken down.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
* Not happy having two modules live in the [spec helper](https://github.com/julyytran/ideabox/blob/master/spec/spec_helper.rb) but I've had problems in the past having it be included if it's not in the spec helper. Have not gotten the chance to investigate again recently.
