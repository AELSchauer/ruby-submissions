## Completion

### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
* No

# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Cool Code](https://github.com/scottfirestone/idea-box/blob/master/app/models/idea.rb#L1-L16)
* I figured out (read: looked up) how to cycle through enum integer values. I preferred this approach to dealing with the strings.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Uncool Code](https://github.com/scottfirestone/idea-box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js#L137-L154)
* I feel like this could benefit from a lot of refactoring.
