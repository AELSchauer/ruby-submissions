### Notes

* Game is decently playable. Some unpredictability of the speed unless you refresh.
* You can shoot ducks
* Used Canvas for moving the duck around
* 15 tests that all pass
* Decided to improve code rather than build more features
* JS implementation looks pretty clean
* Look for opportunities to push functionality out of your "god object" into the children -- out from index.js into other files.
