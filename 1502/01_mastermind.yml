    notes: 'One test failing out of the box. Some test coverage of core game logic. Gameplay is fine with some
            disagreement on feedback. Few objects with too many jobs.'

    notes: 'No tests. Guess feedback is good for correct element in correct position, but misses right element
            in the wrong position. Code needs more refinement. Extract small classes with a single responsibility.'
