    notes: 'Good number of tests overall, but the tests themselves need to dig deeper into the code.
            Game play is fine.'

    notes: 'One test failing out of the box. Some test coverage of core game logic. Gameplay is fine with some
            disagreement on feedback. Few objects with too many jobs.'
