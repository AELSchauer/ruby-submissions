* 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
* 3: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
* 2: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>70%) but does not adequately balance controller and unit tests.
* 1: Project does not have 70% test coverage.

* 2: Project has inconsistencies or gaps in how its JSON data is organized or formatted.
* 1: Project's API is not fully functional or has significant confusion around request formats.

**4. Queries**

* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.
* 3: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.
* 2: Project has some gaps in ActiveRecord usage, including numerous business methods that rely on ruby enumerables to find the appropriate data.
