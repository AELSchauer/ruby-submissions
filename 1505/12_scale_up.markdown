__Notes:__

* 500ms at about 100 rpm
* Categories only used includes, could use pagination and caching.
* load script only really achieves sub 100 rpm.
* understanding of the various techniques on how to improve performance has been achieved,
just needs to combine them to bring performance up, or time down.
