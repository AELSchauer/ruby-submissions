Notes:

* Given till 5pm today today to branch the optimized version off and re-write the functions with improved readability in mind. Will upgrade Ruby score if completed.
* Advised to try Benchmarking with enormous arrays
* Noted that testing score is not a 'juicy 4'

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: All three sort classes work as expected

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### 3. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 2: Code runs effectively but has large issues with readability (long methods, confusing method or variable names, etc)

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase
