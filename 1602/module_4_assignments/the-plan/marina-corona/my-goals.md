# Goals

Whether you're going right into a job, still job hunting, or repeating module 4 - you should work to identify goals for how you want to continue growing technically as a developer.

This could be something like 'learn GoLang', 'contribute to open source', 'improve my JavaScript abilities', 'build a weird thing'

At the end of module 3, you became a 'real developer' - so when you think about how to achieve these goals you should be thinking of them like a developer would. For example, if you walk in to an interview and say you know Go, that means you've built something in Go, not that you've taken a codeschool AND codacademy course in Go and followed along with a TODO app tutorial.

Focus on real ways you can demonstrate your learning and motivate yourself to keep at it.

### Identify

List three individual learning goals that you would like to accomplish over the next year.

Learn Vim or Emacs by using one as my primary text editor/ shell
work on an open source project outside of Readme help.
Complete an actual whole exercism group for a new language (Elixir, Python, JavaScript)

### Define

For each goal:
  - State where you are currently at with this goal
  I have played a couple of games on a tutorial for Vim. I have been to a few posse meetings for Elixir and attempted some Elixir Koans.  I have navigated open source projects.
  - Define what success looks like after 1 year
  Success will mean having grown at the rate at which I was growing at Turing and be happily employed by a company I really love, or happy in other pursuits. Never stop learning!
  - Outline resources for learning
    - List books, blogs, talks, podcasts and courses that would be useful in learning more
    
    - List mentors you know or places you could find mentors who could help you along the way
        - List meetups and conferences related to this goal (if relevant)
    - List ideas or links to things you could or are currently building to achieve this goal. (check out the side-hustle assignment)
    - List ideas for lightning talks or conference talks that you could give on this topic. (check out the community involvement assignment)
    - List open source projects that relate to this goal (check out the open source assignment)
  - Why is this goal important to you?
