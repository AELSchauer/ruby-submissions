### Game Name

Warlords

### Give a Basic Description of the Game

4 player pong/breakout game. Each player starts in one corner with walls around him and a paddle in front of his walls.
A single ball bounces around the screen. If it hits a paddle, it bounces off, if it hits a wall it destroys the piece and bounces off.
The objective is to destroy enough of the wall in front of a player to hit the player with the ball, which knocks them out of the game.
The winner is the last player standing.

## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- four users connect to the server
- a ball is dropped in the middle moving in a random direction
- players can move paddles around their walls
- if a ball hits the paddle it bounces off
- if a ball hits a wall it bounces off and destroys the piece
- If a ball hits the player then that player is out of the game
- the winner is the last player standing
- lobbies or rooms for more than 1 game at a time
- multiple balls after certain amount of time passes in game
- power ups embedded in players walls, when a ball hits them, the player who hit them get the power up.


### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- four users connect to the server
- a ball is dropped in the middle moving in a random direction
- players can move paddles around their walls
- if a ball hits the paddle it bounces off
- if a ball hits a wall it bounces off and destroys the piece
- If a ball hits the player then that player is out of the game
- the winner is the last player standing

### What have you accomplished so far?

- we individually worked through a couple appropriate tutorials (like the mozilla breakout tutorial and another for websocket basics)
- other than that, we only did some additional research and messed around with some concepts. No actual work on the project.
