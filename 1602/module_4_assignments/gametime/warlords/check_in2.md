# Game Time Check In # 2

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOAL 1

- [aws elasticbeanstalk] (http://warlordsnode-env.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)
- [heroku] (http://still-tundra-75849.herokuapp.com/?)
- [github] (https://github.com/drew-t/node-gametime/tree/heroku_test)

I did not deviate.  Need to figure out static file requiring in Node/Express.  Or move to 2 separate projects.


### GOAL 2

- [github] (https://github.com/drew-t/gametime/tree/paddle)

No.  None.


### GOAL 3

- [github] (https://github.com/drew-t/gametime/tree/collision-test)

No. Testing private methods vs. assigning to object.  Refactoring ideas?


## Next Steps?

- Get sockets going with relevant information so that we can start using them for the actual project.
- Integrate ball and paddles
- Add walls/flag(player)
- Have fun.
