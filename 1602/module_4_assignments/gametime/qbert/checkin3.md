### Extensions:
	- Characters are animated between squares.
	- Level completion automatically starts next level of play.
	- Enemies land randomly on second level of pyramid, and proceed randomly down the pyramid.
	- Difficulty increases as enemies arrive faster, level by level.

## Next Steps?
- Saving scores in local storage.
- Level completion graphics and UI/graphics tweaks.
- More complex enemies as levels increase.

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
 - Where should we push to production? Are there any requirements?
 - To what extent should we be integration testing?
 - If we turned in this project as-is, about where are we sitting on points?
