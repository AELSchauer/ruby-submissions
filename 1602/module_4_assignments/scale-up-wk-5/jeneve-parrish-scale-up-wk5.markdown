### Summary of what I worked on the last two weeks

I did a lot of research into animating with CSS, using the Sketch design app and SVG. I paired with my team to
refactor the code in the project and fix some major bugs, and in so doing learned a lot about the structure and workings
React components. I think we did work that will enormously help the next teams make real progress in adding new features and improving User Experience. I spent an inordinate amount of time debugging npm package version stuff on my machine.

### Something I didn't know before the prework...

How to structure a React App. I know know about state and props and how to use them. I know about Hash History and how the browser knows about state in a client-side application. I know the fundamentals of CSS animation.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

It's pretty neat to get feedback from outside the project, much of what we heard from mentors was great feedback and often
led to the creation of new issues on the project.

It was always interesting to look at bits of code from Whiskey Tango projects in particular, and I was surprised that there was usually a little something that I could chime in on.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

Feels awkward, but maybe this is by design, to keep them short and on topic. I did like hearing about what the back-end team was doing.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

The back-end team created a new end-point for showing all past jobs per company, we didn't get around to using it, but that would be a great feature. Generally I'd love to see some wire-framing for the site so that design-oriented participants can push the look and feel of the site with agreed-upon intention.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I wish there was more time for this...oh --- wait --- no, I don't --- I wish I had a job like this.
