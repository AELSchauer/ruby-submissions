# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

  I've worked on WebGL for the last few weeks. I learned an overview of what WebGL is, and how it works. Figure out the different functions to create a 3D object and how to render them. Part of the focus was on all the new terminology and part of it was how does it work. Playing with Shaders and lighting and learning some math.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

  I had no idea linear algebra was a thing. Luckily it seems super intemidating, but when you get into it it's not so bad.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
  
 - It felt very detached this time around. When Ashwin and I worked on gametime we took our PR reviews seriously. We spent a lot of energy on it and wrote back and forth. It was great. On this project I was kind of working on my own, and didn't know what everyone else was doing. When I tried jumping in to there project, I had to give very basic pr reviews on high level stuff because I didn't really know what they were working on. I like having the time to explore, but this was a large drawback.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

- I loved the standups on the other hand. It kept me somewhat in the loop and connected. It was fun to hear what everyone else was working on. Also it was nice to hear everyone was struggling with the projects they picked and that I wasn't the only one.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below! 

- There was some blowback about how this scale up project went. That we should have had more classes and direction, but I disagree. It wasn't comfortable, but it was rewarding to go out on a limb and try new things. I think it's a great skill to work on before we're released into the wild.
