### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks
For the first week of Scale Up:
- research spike that made me realize GlassDoor is an API that will not be used
  - Documented the reason on BaseCamp
- Add number of pages to an API endpoint
- Finding out that there was never a bug in one of the issues that was opened.

For the second week of Scale Up:
- Created more valid specs for the WeWorkRemotely Service that wasn't even using real data for testing methods that was in the service
- Documenting my understanding on Rails 5 and how the project can be shifted into that version of Rails

### Link to blog post(s) submitted
[Blog Post!](https://medium.com/@SalviGod/team-work-45cfbc24a1a0#.okspu37vb)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
Read blog post for more details on this topic.

TLDR: A lot of valid opinions but at the end of the day it's just another way of implementing the same thing.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I enjoyed it because it got us to vent out a lot of the stuff many of the students and I were going through. It was also really awesome on how Meeka would be very open minded in listening to us and being able to support us in our final weeks in Turing.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?
If the project ever does grow it would be nice to have something that'll be able to benchmark the application itself. By benchmarking this project, it'll prioritize the discussion of needing to use ElasticSearch.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
