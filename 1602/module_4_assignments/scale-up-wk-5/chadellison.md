# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks
I built a Texas Holdem (Poker) Rails application using web sockets
For this project I hand-rolled my own game logic(I did use a lot of the logic
from a previous project I did). I used Rails 5's new feature, Action Cable, to
implement web sockets. This allowed the app to have realtime updates for multiple
players. I integrated AI players into the application as well. Users can play with
other AI players, other users, or both, all with real time updates.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
Before this week, I did not know how to update the dom on just on particular user's
connection. I enjoyed figuring out how to do that, and it was easier than I thought
it would be.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
[PR Submission]("https://github.com/chadellison/texas_holdem/pull/22")
[PR Review]("https://github.com/kamiboers/twobert/pull/1/files")
I really enjoy the process of reviewing other's code and having feedback from others. The feedback from
some of the alumns / more experienced developers was especially helpful. I think I will enjoy this process
a lot more when there is more time to experiment with various suggestions.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
Stand ups were great because they helped involve other people in personal struggles and acheivements.
I believe that the small amount of time doing stand ups improved the community, relieved some stress,
and encouraged people to support one another.
