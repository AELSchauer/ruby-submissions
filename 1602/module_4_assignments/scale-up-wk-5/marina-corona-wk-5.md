I really loved writing the blog because I learned a lot about React.js, primarily it's basic structure and how it works.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

PR Reviews have been good and also a growing experience. I love the feedback, however, with the amount of feedback it's hard to take it all in.  Often feedback is delayed and so I have to go back and fix things I already did.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

It's been good to hear that other people are in the same boat but the timing is hard some times. 

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
