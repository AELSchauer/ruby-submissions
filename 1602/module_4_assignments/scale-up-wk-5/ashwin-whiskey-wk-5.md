# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

I built a greenfield single-page app using an ExpressJS server and React for the frontend. I also used CSS to do the basic styling of the page, as well as to draw a letter using HTML divs and CSS attributes.

When I was feeling burned out I got myself started learning Java.

I had a goal of animating the CSS letter so that it would transition from a capital to lowercase a but didn't get to that.

I'm happy to have satisfied my other goals of getting a deployable project with a JS backend up from sratch, hooking up the React library to it, and also now feeling like it's not a lie to put HTML/CSS on my resume.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

I did not know that I have a tendnency to see injustice when it would be more fair to see people doing their best in difficult circumstances. I didn't know that I had been failing to assume the best of people. I didn't know that I needed to focus more on asking questions to understand what was going on with others instead of making assumptions.

Also, I didn't know that I didn't have a clue about what state actually means in React. Or what it feels like to have to compile code before getting to run it. Now I know more about both of those!

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

* giving PR feedback

I enjoyed looking at other people's code. Often I felt like I could read it and get a sense of what was going on. I think that's a testament to both how much I've learned and how much my classmates have learned, because it takes two to read and write code.

I also did feel out of my league when the environments got very complicated, like testing in JS framework. And sometimes I just felt like I was piling on more things to the todo lists of others while knowing that if I got the comments I was giving I would definitely file those away in a "not gonna happen" pile.

* getting PR feedback

Most of the time, I really appreciated the comments from my classmates and the larger community. I got some really useful comments from a ["blairanderson"](https://github.com/theonlyrao/alpha_animate/pull/14) that along with some help from Steve got me going on a better direction.

I could do without the comments about formatting/comments/commit messages. But overall, I really good experience.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

It was a good exercise. I think a little harder for us independent study folks, since we couldn't really help each other that much. But it is good accountability because it really makes it clear that time is marching by ad work needs to get done.
