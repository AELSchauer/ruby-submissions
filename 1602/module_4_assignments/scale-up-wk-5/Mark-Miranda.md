### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
I didn't know how much Ember was similar to rails. I also didn't know they are one of the only major js frameworks to not have been picked up, bought or owned by a major corporation (Angular - Google, React - Facebook)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

It was an interesting experience. I feel like I have the most confidence in my abilities since I've been at Turing, but it's always a step back when your peers are looking at your code, let alone mentors and alums. It was great being able to work with people who have differing views and better ways to write code.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

It was a mixed bag, I liked doing them because it gave semi-real world introductions to what we'll hopefully be doing soon. The collaborative feel of stand-ups is also great too. I like being able to know that people are willing to help me, or point me in the right direction. The mixed bag part comes from majority of us being exhausted. Stand-ups often turned into sit-downs for some (not that I care semantically about what we were doing), and sometimes we just did nothing and had nothign to report. It was still great though.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

Maybe exposure or a push towards frameworks/libraries in the weeks before? I feel like I couldve accomplished more in the project if we didn't spend a lot of time researching and trying to learn a new language

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

This was a great project! Thank you!
