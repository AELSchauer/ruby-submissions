# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

  I stared with a goal to learn Reactive.native and make the app that I created for my Module 3 final [OutdoorAdventure](https://outdooradventuretime.herokuapp.com/) into a mobile app. My original goal was to have a beautiful functioning app, quickly I realize that this was not going to happen in time. So I changed the plan a bit, implemented some Agile strategies, and am proud to say I have a fully functioning App!

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
  I went and looked at all the cool stuff that react.native can do and hope to be able to plan to add that to my app in the near future. I also found a cool program called fetch-bluebird which makes fetching an api quicker and improved the performance of my app.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
Doing PR reviews wasn't to bad. It was good to look at other peoples code and being able to learn from and also help when needed. As far as my personal app goes. Throughout the Turing Community there is a very limited amount of people who know much about React.native.

First off I must thank Tino Espinoza for all of his help and also a shout out to my external mentor Ed.

The PR review is fantastic in my opinion and I hope to actually have the same experience in the real world with my first developers job.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
Just coming to hear Meeka's stories about her professors weird names and the adventures of food cultures she tries was worth it.

Honestly, I think the daily stands ups are great. It feels good to know that I was not the only one lost and tired. Also need to do a shout out to Sunny! Him and I were the only ones who did a React.native app.
### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I really didn't know if I could finish this app within a two week mark. Learning a new language and implementing it quickly was definitely difficult. By my third day I knew I was not going to be able to accomplish what I wanted, my check list of likes and wants where unrealistic within the time line.

Meeka specifically explained to me that it wasn't about turing in a functional app but about the knowledge gained from this assignment. I take a lot of pride in everything I do and always give a 110%. It was very important for me to turn in some sort of functional app, so I decided to create an Agile system that would allow me to have some sort of functional app by the end of this project. I am proud to say that this achievement is by far one of the most satisfying moments of my time at Turing. I have a fully functional App!
