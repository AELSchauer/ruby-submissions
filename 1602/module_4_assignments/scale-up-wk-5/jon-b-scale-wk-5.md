### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

  My experience on this project was different then any before, especially with git workflow

  I was more detailed in my PR's and also was more cogniscent of others PRs. Each PR received lots of feedback and took longer than I am used to 
  get merged. It was a full team experience with really good code reiew. I truly believe that only the best code was getting merged. It was great seeing suggestions and executing them!


### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand up

  Standups were a great way to keep track of everyone and their plans for the day. With a very remote workflow, it was very beneficial to outright claim what you hope to get done.

  Everyone was very understanding of other obligations which was nice.

### Overview: 

  This was an awesome experience that was very different from other projects. I really enjoyed working with Jed and Jill on what is a very real and important project. 
  I hope I was able to contribute during my short time on the project. I plan on moving forward working on it until its complete. I learned alot more about rails and new tech, but most of all learned more about agile and remote development!
