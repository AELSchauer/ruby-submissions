### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks

- Mainly just tried to work through the burn out, found that it's a lot harder than one might thing.
- In terms of the project, we did a lot of refactoring and added some minor features.

### Hours logged this week?

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.

- What the heck React is.  I looked into Angular a little in between mod 3 and 4, and I just assumed they would be similar, but they're very different.

- React is component based, whereas Angular is more like a front end Rails.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

- [gametime in java](https://medium.com/@jdliss/let-the-game-time-begin-c3cc6c2fe02c#.3nyf262zu)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

- The whole PR system was pretty interesting.  There were some annoying things and some really good things.  I felt like some of the time people were leaving fairly pointless feedback just to be able to say that they participated.  Other times we got really in-depth and awesome feedback.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

- I liked standups, they're good for a bit of grounding.  You have to stop working and talk to people about what you did, and get to hear about what they're working on.  Sometimes I would be frustrated and subconsciously think that I was alone in that, and then I'd go to standup and hear someone else express they same things I was thinking.

- They're also good to remind yourself that you're a part of a bigger team than just your project team.  Coming together with the backend group and the MentorShip group was fun and a bit of a diversion (but still related to the project).

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

- Search by Company name

- Better location search

- Better styling
