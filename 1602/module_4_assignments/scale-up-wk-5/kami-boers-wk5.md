# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks:
I set out to make a two player web-based game using socket.io, node and express. Though I didn't reach this goal, I did push my knowledge about these topics much futher, and was able to implement a local two-player game with some graphic enhancement, and to serve the game using node express.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
I feel like the greatest benefit that this week has has provided me is a deeper understanding of what is going on in the projects that we've made in the past. Instead of moving forward as quickly as possible without full understanding of what I was implementing, I really took the time to find out what each module was doing and why. I think that I really expanded my toolset and ability to describe my work.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
I doubt that this opinion will be popular, but I actually enjoyed the PR reviews. The commentary that I received on my pull request was pretty targeted criticism or praise, and it seemed like a pretty helpful and congenial conversation from my point of view. It was a little different to be offering code up for complete strangers in addition to classmates, but I really liked how easily people could point out issues in my code, and I was able to quickly make changes because of how specific these criticisms were. I'm sure it gets more charged in the workplace, but I think PR review can be a great tool if people are really interested in constructive criticism.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I really liked hearing about where my classmates were. I almost wish that we'd done these earlier in Turing, because I thought that it was a great way to discuss progress and share blockers with people. If I felt like I wasn't working on my 4th or 5th wind as we wrap up our time at Turing, I might have gotten more out of these.
