# Scale Up Submission Form - Open Source Projects

## Basics

### Link(s) to the PRs or Issues You Picked Up

* [GitHub OAuth in Rails](https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/MentorSHIP-API/pull/4)
* [Documentation for future buccaneers](https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/mentorSHIP-documentation)

### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks

Pushing through burn out and accepting, and learning from failure. I spent more time reading than actually programming. I learned a ton about Authentication and Authorization, Ember.js and working with front end applications in general.

### Hours logged this week?

- Monday (0 hours): 0
- Tuesday (8 hours): 7:00
- Wednesday (8 hours): 7:11
- Thursday (8 hours): 3:00
- Friday (0 hours): 4:00
- Saturday: untracked time writing blog post and documentation

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.

Even though Ember has a lot of similarities to Rails, it's also very different.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

My original idea for a blogpost about authentication was scrapped, because we ultimately didn't finish the system we had envisioned.

A lot of the thoughts I had regarding that were instead put into [the MentorSHIP documentation](https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/mentorSHIP-documentation) for the next group of students who choose to hoist the sails.

After writing that documentation, and due to some of the issues I encountered reviewing PRs, I wrote a blog post about documentation.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

I only had 1 PR each week and didn't get a lot of meaningful feedback on either one. But I enjoyed the process of reviewing other peoples. Most of my PR reviews can be summed up by this image:
###### Replace cloud with lack of readme

I did spend about an hour trying to debug Kris having an issue with the asset pipeline.
* [PR](https://github.com/kristindiannefoss/snap_me_up/pull/3)

And a couple hours debugging Claudia's controller test errors
* [PR](https://github.com/Claudia108/TexArch/pull/62)

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

I enjoyed standup, it was fun to get an idea what everyone was working on, even if I usually felt pretty lazy in comparison with what I accomplished.
I did miss standup on Tuesday, as I decided to stay home in the morning to work and go in after lunch, but ended up falling asleep at my desk around noon.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

A functioning prototype, that's well documented. I'd like to keep involved with this and keep a close eye on the next group of students to take up the project.
