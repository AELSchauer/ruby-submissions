# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

I learned a lot about the way react-native works in terms of components, routing, styling, and making api calls, however I don't think that was the key takeaway from this assignment.
This project was riddled with really strange and complex issues. And in dealing with these issues I felt like I was learning a much more valuable skill. Navigating various issue pages, talking with other developers, and reaching out to people more than I ever have before really made this an enlightening experience. I really took for granted to the fact that rails, ruby, javascript, node just ...works. I didn't really think developers would create features in production that just wouldn't work. I felt like this was a true real world coding experience and it was fucking awesome!

The previous week I though I was going to work 8hrs on sat and sun but it turned out to be 4 so I wanted to include the previous weekend.


### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
- How to efficiently go through project issues to find solutions
- How to use react-native-maps and all their features.

### Link to blog post(s)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
I commented here:  
https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/pull/67  
https://github.com/kristindiannefoss/snap_me_up/pull/1  
https://github.com/marinacor1/aggregate_yo/pull/13  
https://github.com/kamiboers/twobert/pull/1

I enjoyed jumping into other peoples code, seeing their coding style and thought processes and hopefully getting to add something meaningful. I didn't submit any pull requests so I made sure to be active on other peoples.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
It was really helpful to hear other peoples experiences during this project. I thought I was going to make a lot more progress than I did, and to hear the same story about new technology ups and downs from other people was really reassuring.
