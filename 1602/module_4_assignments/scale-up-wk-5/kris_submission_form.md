### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.  
This week is when I really made a breakthrough on ajax.  I am using it to be able to access information from my internal api to post to the dom.  It's really helpful to be able to call the external api from app, then use the information because it comes from two different end points.  I also started working with a materialize template.  I feel comfortable with their code but it is a lot less user friendly than bootstrap from what I can tell, or it may just be because I have played with bootstrap so much.  But the asset pipeline is giving me trouble.  

### Link to blog post(s):
Two posts from this week and last are [here](http://codeschoolforwizardsstarttofinish.blogspot.com/)
Titled: "AJAX you up" and "It's Bright Out Here In The Sunshine + [Open Source]"

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
I understand the concept of this but I think it's really hard to jump into someone's code and comment on a snippet.  Not knowing the project code base or sometimes even the language/framework is a huge hindrance to having anything meaningful to offer.  Getting feedback was fine.  I do feel like I had to explain myself because I think I took the project as a chance to explore so I wasn't necessarily presenting my best or clearest, most readable code.  It's also something I don't necessarily want to show to mentors.  This was my least favorite part of the project.  

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
It was interesting to hear what everyone chose to work on and what their struggles/gains were.  I did have some trouble verbalizing what I was doing at first but I felt more comfortable towards the end.  

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
