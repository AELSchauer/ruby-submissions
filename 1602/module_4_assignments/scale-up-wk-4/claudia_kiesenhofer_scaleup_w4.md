### Participation

[Jared's Pull Request](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/pull/108)

Reviewing pull requests are great to exercise understanding someone else's code enough to ask questions and make suggestions. It supports the learning a lot.
I did feel a little insecure though about making suggestions just because I don't know all too much yet about best practices.

[My Pull Request](https://github.com/Claudia108/TexArch/pull/58)

A really interesting process to ask for feedback. I got some really good questions which first annoyed me a bit because I wanted to be done with this feature and not spend more time tweaking. But they ended up pushing me to search for a really good and slick solution which I am really happy with.

### Work Completed

[TexArch](https://github.com/Claudia108/TexArch)

I completed updates in Admin/Sites (remove delete functionality, add 3 attributes. Files changed: Admin/SitesController, site.rb, views/admin/sites, views/sites/show.html.erb, routes). My research on how to tweak my redirect in the sessions controller, serving a site on a custom domain and how to integrate react has been enlightening and useful.
The classes this week (react and css) were all really useful and instrumental for what I implement in the project moving forward.
