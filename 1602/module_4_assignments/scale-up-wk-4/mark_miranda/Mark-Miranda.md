### Participation

- [pr comment](https://github.com/theonlyrao/alpha_animate/pull/7/files#diff-fa3ed1d141a851338dbe81febdda1330)
  - I haven't made a ton of comments on PRs. I've been hyper-focused on learning different flavors of JS and iteration planning. I realize that this isn't necessarily a fully valid excuse, but I think the work on the 'ship warrants more attention because it's a full rebuild.

### Work Completed

- Research
- Yo Ember
- Rails 5 API

- [mentorShip - Front End](https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/MentorSHIP-FrontEnd)
  - Mostly CSS at the moment, working on getting styles in place and ready for when the API is up and ready to go.
