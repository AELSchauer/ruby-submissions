# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Good code](https://github.com/thompickett/idea-box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/search_ideas.js#L11-L35)
* I was pretty happy with this code since it showed me having starting to have a decent understanding on JS. I did it without looking it up and just coded it out. I also think it's nice and concise and gets the job done.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Bad code](https://github.com/thompickett/idea-box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/thumbs_up_or_down.js)
* Not super happy with this code. There's too much duplication. I always meant to get back around to trying to refactor it and never did.
### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'
