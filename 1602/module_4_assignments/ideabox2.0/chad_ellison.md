* Yes, All base functionality and two extensions were completed

###Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

###Code Quality

###Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
* [Proud of](https://github.com/chadellison/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/filter.js)
  This was a fun challenge to tackle and it was when JS started to click for me.

* [Not proud of](https://github.com/chadellison/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/sort.js)
