# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
* Having lost the versatility of active record relationships within javascript. Using this bit of code in the controller which added relationships to the JSON object being returned helped out while doing the tagging extension.

* We lose the method uniq in javascript, but I thought this bit of code that I did was to the point and very re-usable.
