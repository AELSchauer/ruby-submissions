# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[code that puts a smile on my face](https://github.com/Salvi6God/idea-box-1602/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/delete.js)
* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
    - I'm proud of this code because its the most simple one out of all of the main functions being used. I noticed that there is still some gaps for me when it comes to refactoring in JavaScript that'll change as I continue throughout the module.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[update quality](https://github.com/Salvi6God/idea-box-1602/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/update_quality.js)
<br>
[edit feature](https://github.com/Salvi6God/idea-box-1602/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/edit.js)
* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
  I couldn't figure a way out to make the logic follow the DRY convention. The challenge for me was figuring out a way how to make one function differentiate between the type of code that will be passed into the AJAX call.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
