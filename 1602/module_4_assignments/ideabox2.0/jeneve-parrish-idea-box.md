## Completion

### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
* If not, list what functionality is missing.

- Ideas should appear in descending chronological order (with the most recently created idea at the top). (3 points)

_mine shows the most recently updated on top upon page reload._

- Incrementing a "genius" idea or decrementing a "swill" idea should have no effect. (4 points)

_mine shows a retro alert letting you know why nothing happened_

- The user should be able to "commit" their changes by pressing "Enter/Return" or by clicking outside of the text field. (4 points)

_oops, I missed the part about clicking outside the box should also work...it doesn't_

### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
  * none 
### Attach a .gif, or images of any extensions work being used on the site.
  * N/A
# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

_I wrote a request without ajax after many hours of debugging an ajax request_

- [no ajax request](https://github.com/jeneve/idea-box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/functions.js#L7)

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

_in the time I had, it was the best I could do to separate listeners from functions into two files. There is still SO much repetition and so many oppurtunities for refactoring the javascript. the two very similar methods beginning on the linked line number below is an example of the problem._

- [functions.js](https://github.com/jeneve/idea-box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/functions.js#L65)

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

![rspec-sceenshot](https://github.com/jeneve/idea-box/blob/master/app/assets/images/rspec-screenshot.png?raw=true)
