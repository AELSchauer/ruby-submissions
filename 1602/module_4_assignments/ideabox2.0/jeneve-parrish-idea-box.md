# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

 **Why were you proud of this piece of code?**

#####I wrote a request without ajax after many hours of debugging an ajax request, [here.](https://github.com/jeneve/idea-box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/functions.js#L7) Not proud that I could never debug the problem with the ajax request, but proud that I was able to get past it.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
**Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?**

#####in the time I had, it was the best I could do to separate listeners from functions into two files. There is still SO much repetition and so many oppurtunities for refactoring the javascript. The two very similar methods beginning on the linked line number below is an example of the problem.[ here.](https://github.com/jeneve/idea-box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/functions.js#L65)

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
