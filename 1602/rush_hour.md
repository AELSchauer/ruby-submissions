## Evaluation Rubric

Team: Jonathan Liss & Christopher Soden & Hedy Woo
Evaluator: Rachel

Notes:

* all iterations are complete; data in iteration 8 is not scoped per client
* refactor payload parser + client parser by Wed. to get Ruby scores
* client methods tested for muliple clients sometimes, but not consistent
* feature tests looked good -- good use of scoping to specific HTML elements
* good use of ActiveRecord for queries
* views looked good -- no logic leaking through 

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations
* 2: Application has some small missing base functionality

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* 2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

#### Workflow (NOT GRADED)

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
* 2: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.
* 1: Little use of branches, pull requests, and/or a project-management tool.

Team: Sal Espinosa & Jeneve Parrish & Gurusundesh Khalsa & Alireza Andersen
Evaluator: Rachel

Notes:

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills base expectations and adds two extensions
* 3: Application fulfills base expectations
* 2: Application has some small missing base functionality

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not hit all cases for specific methods

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3.5

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

#### 6. View Layer
