### Travel Bug

### Pitch

At times we don’t travel as much as we want and my app would help entice users to plan their trips according to budget and other features.

### Problem

Planning a trip can be a little daunting at times and my app would approach it in a more simplistic way where the user can enter a location to visit and plan their trip on a day-to-day basis. Possibly entering expenses as well as places to visit, eat etc.

### Solution

I would like the app to include a day-to-day travel plan, places to go, total cost of the trip, distance etc.

### Target Audience

Anyone that is tired of the everyday rut and would like to enrich their lives with more culture, food and new people.

### Integrations

Which APIs will you use?
  I will be using Numbeo’s and Google Maps API at this point
  Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
    Facebook OAuth as most people have a Facebook account.
