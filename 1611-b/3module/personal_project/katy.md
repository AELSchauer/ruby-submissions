Pitch

Shine is a browser-based game that encourages users to interact with their world by offering surprises and challenges around
ever corner. When users engage with their surroundings, they begin to shine, becoming the best, shiniest version of themselves.

Problem

In 2015, an estimated 16.1 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States had at least one major depressive episode. Many
of us suffer, and learning how to take care of ourselves is one of the most difficult challenges we face. It can be difficult
to engage with other people or anything outside of the house on depressive days.

Solution

Shine teaches self-care techniques through gameplay and rewards users for treating themselves well by making them shiny. Even if
players are not able to apply the techniques to their real lives, gameplay is a great outlet to soothe the pain of depression.

Target Audience

My target audience is people who suffer from mental illnesses who would like a respite from being in their heads. I also think
that many other people will enjoy the gameplay and overall experience.
