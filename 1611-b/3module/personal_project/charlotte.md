Title: Information is everywhere
Pitch: Because we live in a time in which information is everywhere it is easy to find claims of fact which support our assumptions and deny the ideas with which we disagree.
Problem: There is an implicit bias in the news we consume that is shaped by the assumptions and beliefs of the people who manufacture it. This prediliction hides behide the comforting assumption that the news is a neutral source of information.
Solution: With this app I intend to do sentiment analysis on news articles and do some kind of data visualization with the result. My hope is that this visualization will help those who interact with it understand the need to be critical of information.
Target audience: People who might find it interesting.
Integrations: Watson api for sentiment analysis
I need to do more research.
