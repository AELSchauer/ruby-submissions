### Pitch

An app that allows you to monitor all aspects of your fish tank from water parameters to what fish you have,
when you bought them, etc. You would also be able to get information about stores near you that sell products
for your fish tank. You will also have the ability to review/comment on the vendors to let other users know of
sales or even a disease that your tank got from that particular store which would help save fish lives.

### Problem

Maintaining a healthy environment for your tank and your fish and keeping track of local shops that you frequent.

### Solution

Allow you to monitor all of your water parameters throughout time so you can see trends in certain parameter spikes.

Allow you to view stores near you and user comments about store quality, sales and other pertinent information.

See a map and get directions to the store of your choice(near you).

Diagnose fish tank problems.(i.e. “What do I do if I have ick?”)

### Target Audience

Aquarium owners beginner to advanced, ages 10-45
