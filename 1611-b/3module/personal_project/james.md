### Due Diligence

### Pitch
This app aims to be a one-stop-shop for potential homebuyers by conglomerating available data to help make a more informed decision on arguably life's biggest investment.

### Problem
The overwhelming number of factors involved with purchasing a home lead many buyers to overlook certain aspects that would affect their quality of life.

### Solution
This app would cross-reference multiple sources to help the consumer save time and collect as much information as possible before purchasing a home.

### Target Audience
This app is aimed at potential homebuyers.

### Integrations
This app would take an iterative approach to consume more data sources as the project progresses.
