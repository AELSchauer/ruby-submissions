### Water Quality Monitor

### Pitch

Form-factor autonomous water quality collection and analysis suite.

### Problem

People are not aware of how the quality of natural bodies of smaller natural bodies of water compare to statewide statistics.

### Solution

I will build an autonomous form factor water quality monitoring station that will host a database of sensor information and host said information on an API. I will then create a standalone web application to consume the foreign API as well as other, foreign, water quality APIs. This application will also host a suit of comparative statistics built from the foreign API data.

### Target Audience

Land owners that wish to autonomously check the quality of water on their properties. W/a solar system: Park rangers / environmentalists that want a cheap and easy way to monitor bodies of water.

* Which APIs will you use?
-   National Water Quality Monitoring Council API

* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
