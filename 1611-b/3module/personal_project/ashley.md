### Wedding Budget

### Pitch

Weddings are big business. The average cost of a wedding now surpasses the cost of a brand new car. Regardless of who is planning the wedding, the bride, the groom, or a third-party planner, the management of money is a major concern. However, the tools for money management provided by the two major sites -- Wedding Wire and The Knot -- are lacking. Especially when faced with the logistical challenges of budgeting and financing a wedding.

### Problem

Current wedding applications have a way to set up a budget, but no way of tracking expenses.
1) When you sign contracts with vendors, you don't pay the full due at once, and you need to be able to track what you've paid vs what you've committed yourself to paying.
2) People who have longer engagements use that time to save for the wedding, honeymoon, etc, so it would be helpful to track how much saved vs. spent/committed, or how much someone needs to save monthly to pay for their wedding.
3) Some expenses, like food, depends on the number of guests that RSVP, so it's difficult to model and compare different budgets depending on the number of guests.
4) There is no way, on these major sites, to host files (e.g. signed contracts by vendors).

### Solution

1) Being able to track not only how much you've paid, but how much you've committed to pay in contracts, and then having both appear in your budget.
2) Create a scheduler where the system determines how much you have to save per month to pay your obligations on time (or the user puts in how much they are currently saving and whether or not that's enough).
3) Include functionality that show different models side by side by the number of guests and allows you to allocate money to other expenses depending on how many people RSVP.

### Target Audience

Brides, probably, but maybe some accounting oriented grooms. If the application is built well, it could even apply to anyone who needs to plan an event.
