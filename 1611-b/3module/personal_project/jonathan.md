### [Success of Scholarships] [Name WIP]
### Pitch
This app provides information to students researching post secondary institutions in Colorado, of what scholarships are available and how those scholarships translate to graduation rates from that institution when compared to another institution. When you compare two institutions you will see their graduation rates based on pre selected fields by the user, revolving around ethnicity. What scholarships are offered for that ethnicity and what the graduation percentage is for that ethnicity.
### Problem
Most High School students are clueless when it comes to choosing a post secondary institution, they need guidance, having data helps with solidifying their choice.
### Solution
Create an app that provides  information of scholarships for that school, the gradation rate for that school, the location of that school.  Graduation rates and scholarships will be scoped by ethnicity.
### Target Audience
The app is designed for High School students and their families, counselors etc. It gives them another tool to use when determining what school to attend. Primarily the main focus is for 1st generation minority students whom really struggle when it comes to making these types of decisions as they have no real previous guidance.
### Integrations
* Which APIs will you use?
https://data.colorado.gov/
google geolocation api
* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
None this is suppose to be a public application, restricting data is not the purpose but if it must really be implemented using OAuth 2.0 through Facebook or Google.
