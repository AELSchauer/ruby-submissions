Commute Tracker

### Pitch

Drop two pins on a Google map (one home, one work). These pins tell the the you yearly commute time and gas expenses

### Problem

Once I’m employed, I’ll want to find a spot to live that balances distance from work and time wasted getting to work.
### Solution

This app would help give insight into how much time I could expect to be in that limbo state of not being productive per year.

### Target Audience

Target audience would be people graduating from school, that are interested in understanding how much time they may be spending in their commute.

### Integrations

* Which APIs will you use?
Google Maps

* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
facebook

### Iterations
By Monday I want to have figured out how to display a Map and drop pins on it that connect

By Friday I want to have roughly calculated commute time from specific locations

By the following Monday I want to have commute times that display cleanly in the view

If time allows I want to get gas expenses put in as another resource to filter by
——————————————————————————————————————————————————

What if it becomes apparent by Monday late evening that this isn’t going to work?

I know I want to start working with Javascript/React/Node

I’d set the goal of building out a to do list app in React
